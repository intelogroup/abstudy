Her father was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 43, and her mother was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer at age 52. She is sexually active with multiple partners \nand has not seen a physician since a car accident 15 years ago. She denies any \nsymptoms at this time, and her physical examination is normal. She asks what is \nrecommended for a woman her age.\nScreening tests are done on seemingly healthy people to identify those at increased risk of dis -\nease. Even if a diagnostic test is available, however, that does not necessarily mean it should be \nused to screen for a particular disease.\n• Several harmful effects may potentially result from screening tests.\n• Any adverse outcome that occurs (large bowel perforation secondary to a colonoscopy) is \niatrogenic.\n• Screening may be expensive, unpleasant, and/or inconvenient.\n• Screening may also lead to harmful treatment.\nFinally, there may be a stigma associated with incorrectly labeling a patient as “sick. ”\nFor all diseases for which screening is recommended, effective intervention must exist, and the \ncourse of events after a positive test result must be acceptable to the patient. Most important, the \nscreening test must be valid, i.e., it must have been shown in trials to decrease overall mortality in \nthe screened population. For a screening test to be recommended for regular use, it has to be \nextensively studied to ensure that all of the requirements are met.Preventive Medicine 1\n01_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch01.indd   1 16/05/19   10:29 AM",
    "page_9": "2\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nThe 4 malignancies for which regular screening is recommended are cancers of the colon, \nbreast , cervix, and lung .\nColon Cancer\nIn the patient with no significant family history of colon cancer, screening should begin at age \n50. The preferred screening modality for colon cancer is colonoscopy every 10 years. Other \nchoices include annual fecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy with barium enema every \n5 years.\nIn the patient with a single first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer before \nage  60 or multiple first-degree relatives with colon cancer at any age, colonoscopy should \nbegin at  age 40 or 10 years before the age at which the youngest affected relative was \ndiagnosed, whichever age occurs earlier . In these high-risk patients, colonoscopy should \nbe repeated every 5 years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not \nrecommend routine screening in patients age >75.\nBreast Cancer\nThe tests used to screen for breast cancer are mammography and manual breast exam. \nMammography with or without clinical breast exam is recommended every 1–2 years from age \n50–74. The American Cancer Society no longer recommends monthly self-breast  examination \nalone as a screening tool. Patients with very strong family histories of breast cancer (defined as \nmultiple first-degree relatives) should consider prophylactic tamoxifen, discussing risks and \nbenefits with a physician. Tamoxifen prevents breast cancer in high-risk individuals.\nCervical Cancer\nThe screening test of choice for the early detection of cervical cancer is the Papanicolaou smear \n(the “Pap” test). In average risk women, Pap smear screening should be started at age 21, \nregardless of onset of sexual activity . It should be performed every 3 years until age 65. \nAs an alternative, women age 30–65 who wish to lengthen the screening interval to every \n5 years can do co-testing with Pap and HPV testing. In higher risk women, e.g., HIV , more \nfrequent screening or screening after age 65 may be required.\nLung Cancer\nCurrent recommendations for lung cancer screening are as follows:\n• Annual screening with low-dose CT in adults age 55–80 who have a 30-pack-year \nsmoking history and currently smoke or have quit within past 15 years\n• Once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem substantially \nlimiting life expectancy or ability/willingness to have curative lung surgery, screening \nshould be discontinuedNote\nTamoxifen prevents cancer by \n50% in those with >1 family \nmember with breast cancer.\nNote\nProstate Screening\nUSPSTF concludes that the \ncurrent evidence is insufficient \nto assess the balance of \nbenefits/risks of prostate \ncancer screening in men age \n<75. It recommends against \nscreening in men age >75.\nFor USMLE, do not screen for \nprostate cancer.\n01_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch01.indd   2 16/05/19   10:29 AM",

A 17-year-old woman is screened for HPV via a Pap smear after her \nfirst sexual encounter\nD. A 65-year-old man with a 30-pack-year smoking history gets a low-\ndose CT\nE. A 21-year-old woman with a high risk of developing breast cancer is \ngiven tamoxifen\nAnswer: C\nTRAVEL MEDICINE\nA 44-year-old executive comes to the clinic before traveling to Thailand for \nbusiness. He has no significant past medical history and is here only because his \ncompany will not let him travel until he is seen by a physician. The patient \nappears agitated and demands the physician’s recommendation immediately.\nIt is important to set up a pretravel counseling session 4–6 weeks before the patient’s departure.\nHepatitis A  vaccination is recommended for all travelers to less developed countries. If a \npatient is leaving within 2 weeks of being seen, both the vaccine and immune serum globulin \nare recommended.\nA booster shot given 6 months post-initial vaccination confers immunity for approximately  \n10 years.\nHepatitis B  vaccination is recommended for patients who work closely with indigenous popula -\ntions. Additionally, patients who plan to engage in sexual intercourse with the local populace, to \nreceive medical or dental care, or to remain abroad for >6 months should be vaccinated.\nMalaria:  Mefloquine is the agent of choice for malaria prophylaxis. It is given once per week; it \nmay cause adverse neuropsychiatric effects such as hallucinations, depression,  suicidal \nideations, and unusual behavior. Doxycycline is an acceptable alternative to  mefloquine, \nalthough photosensitivity can be problematic. For pregnant patients requiring chemoprophy-\nlaxis for malaria, chloroquine is the preferred regimen.Note\nHepatitis A infection is the \nmost common vaccine-\npreventable disease in travelers. \nIt can occur wherever there is \nfecal contamination of food/\ndrinking water.\n01_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch01.indd   3 24/05/19   4:16 PM",
    "page_11": "4\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nRabies  vaccination is recommended for patients traveling to areas where rabies is common \namong domesticated animals (India, Asia, Mexico). Chloroquine can blunt the response to the \nintradermal  form of rabies vaccine. Therefore, in patients who require malaria prophylaxis, in \naddition to rabies prophylaxis the intramuscular  form of the vaccine should be administered. \nRabies vaccination is not considered a routine vaccination for most travelers.\nTyphoid  vaccination is recommended for patients who are traveling to developing countries \nand will have prolonged exposure to contaminated food and water. Typhoid vaccination comes \nin 2 forms, an oral live attenuated form and a capsular polysaccharide vaccine given parenter -\nally. The live attenuated form (1) needs to be refrigerated, and (2) is contraindicated in patients \nwho are HIV-positive. The polysaccharide vaccine is given intramuscularly as a single injection. \nSide effects include irritation at the injection site. Fever and headache are rare adverse reactions \nto the vaccine. The polysaccharide vaccine is the preferred form for almost all subjects as it is \nwell-tolerated and convenient (no need for refrigeration). It is safe for HIV patients.\nPolio:  Adults who are traveling to developing countries and have never received a polio \nvaccine should receive 3 doses of the inactivated polio vaccine. Patients who have been \npreviously immunized should receive a 1-time booster. The live attenuated polio vaccine is no \nlonger recommended because of the risk of vaccine-associated disease.\nPatients traveling to areas where meningococcal meningitis  is endemic or epidemic (  Nepal, \nsub-Saharan Africa, northern India) should be immunized with the polysaccharide vaccine. \nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia requires immunization for pilgrims to Mecca. Patients with func -\ntional or actual asplenia and patients with terminal complement deficiencies should also \nreceive the vaccine. Meningococcal vaccine is now routinely administered at age 11.\nTo prevent traveler’s diarrhea , patients should be advised to avoid raw and street vendor \nsalads, unwashed fruit, and tap/ice water. Patients who experience mild loose stools without \nfever or blood can safely take loperamide. Treatment with a fluoroquinolone or azithro  mycin \nis reserved for patients with moderate to severe symptoms.\nIMMUNIZATIONS\nA 52-year-old man comes to the clinic for a health maintenance evaluation. His \nrecent colonoscopy showed no evidence of carcinoma. Recent serum fasting \nglucose, serum cholesterol, and blood pressure are all within normal limits. \nThe patient has a history of smoking and continues to smoke 2 packs per day. He \nwas diagnosed with COPD 3 years ago.\nImmunization is the best method available for preventing serious infectious disease.  Between \n50,000–70,000 adults die every year from preventable infectious disease (influenza, invasive \npneumococcal disease, and hepatitis B). Surveys have shown that among patients who have an \nindication for any vaccination, very few actually receive it (pneumococcal vaccination 20%, \ninfluenza 40%, hepatitis B 10%). For this reason, the American College of Physicians recom -\nmends that every patient’s immunization status be reviewed at age 50 ; evaluate risk factors \nfor specific vaccinations at that time.\n01_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch01.indd   4 16/05/19   10:29 AM",
    "page_12": "Chapter 1   ●  Preventive Medicine\n5\n• Most patients received a primary immunization against tetanus and diphtheria as \nchildren. \n• For those adults who were never vaccinated, give 3 doses. The principle is that adults \nrequire a total of 3 vaccinations against tetanus and diphtheria.\n –Give the first 2 doses 1−2 months apart\n –Give the third dose 6–12 months later\n –Give a booster vaccination every 10 years for life; one of the boosters should use \nTdap instead of Td booster; if wound is dirty, revaccinate after 5 years\nInfluenza Vaccine\nInfluenza vaccine is recommended annually for all adults regardless of age. Patients who have a \nhistory of cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or hemoglobinopathy, or are  \nage 50+ residents of chronic care facilities will derive the greatest benefit from an annual \ninfluenza vaccination. Pregnant women who will be in their second or third trimester during \nthe influenza season should also receive the vaccine.\nPneumococcal Vaccine\nPneumococcal vaccine is indicated for all adults age ≥65. Additionally, the following individu -\nals should receive the vaccine regardless of age:\n• Those with history of sickle-cell disease or splenectomy\n• Those with history of cardiopulmonary disease, alcoholism, or cirrhosis\n• Alaskan natives and certain Native American populations\n• Immunocompromised patients (patients with hematologic malignancies, chronic renal \nfailure, or nephrotic syndrome; HIV-positive patients; or patients receiving immuno -\nsuppressive medications)\nRevaccination should be performed in healthy patients who received their initial vaccination \nage <65 and were age <60 at the time of primary vaccination. Patients with a high risk of fatal \ninfection (CKD, asplenic patients, immunocompromised patients) should be revaccinated 1x \nafter 5 years. No one gets >1 booster shot per lifetime.\nHepatitis B Vaccine\nHepatitis B vaccine is recommended when there is a history of the following:\n• IV drug abuse\n• Male homosexuality\n• Household or sexual contact with hepatitis B carriers\n• Frequent exposure to blood/blood products\n• History of chronic liver disease\nThe hepatitis B vaccine is also recommended for the following individuals:\n• All children through age 18\n• Those with STIsNote\nPatients must get Pneumovax, \nmeningococcal, and \nHaemophilus  vaccines  \n2 weeks before a splenectomy.\n01_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch01.indd   5 16/05/19   10:29 AM",

There are 2 types of vaccine, \nboth of which stimulate active immunity against a future infection.\n• One contains inactivated hepatitis A virus\n• One contains a live but attenuated virus\nFor the best protection, give the vaccine in 2 doses: initial dose and then a booster 6–12 months \nlater. Protection against hepatitis A begins approximately 2–4 weeks after the initial vaccination.\nIn the United States, the vaccine is strongly recommended for all children age 12–23 months \nin an attempt to eradicate the virus nationwide. There are also recommendations that the fol -\nlowing populations be vaccinated:\n• All children age >1 year\n• People whose sexual activity puts them at risk\n• People with chronic liver disease\n• People who are being treated with clotting factor concentrates\n• People who are living in communities where an outbreak is present\nHepatitis A is the most common vaccine-preventable virus acquired during travel, so people \ntravelling to places where the virus is common (Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central America, \nSouth America, the Far East, and Eastern Europe) should be vaccinated.\nVaricella Vaccine\nThe varicella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine recommended for use in all adults who lack a \nhistory of childhood infection with varicella virus. Being a live attenuated vaccine, varicella \nvaccine should not be given to immunocompromised patients, HIV-positive patients when \nsymptomatic or <200 CD4 cells, or pregnant women.\nPatients age ≥60 are recommended to receive the varicella zoster (shingles) vaccine, which has \nbeen shown to reduce the risk of zoster and its associated pain (post-herpetic neuralgia). It is \nindicated regardless of whether there is a history of shingles, as it is possible to have a second \nherpes zoster infection.\nMeasles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine\nThe measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine usually given in \nchildhood. Healthy adults born after 1956 should receive 1 dose of the vaccine. Pregnant \nwomen and immunocompromised patients should not be vaccinated. HIV-positive  patients \nwho are asymptomatic may receive the vaccine.\n01_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch01.indd   6 16/05/19   10:29 AM",

It is also recom-\nmended for young adults living in dormitories or barracks, people exposed to outbreaks, those \nwith asplenia or terminal complement deficiencies, those who travel to endemic  regions \n(traveling to Mecca), and those exposed to Neisseria meningitidis .\nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine\nThe human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for women age 9–26, regardless of \nsexual activity. The regimen is in 3 doses: 0, 2, and 6 months. It should not be administered in \npregnancy.\nHerpes Zoster Vaccine\nThe zoster vaccine is a live vaccine that has been shown to reduce the incidence of shingles by \n50%. It has also been shown to reduce the number of cases of post-herpetic neuralgia, as well \nas the severity and duration of pain/discomfort associated with shingles. The vaccine is, \nbasically, a larger-than-normal dose of the chicken pox vaccine, as both shingles and chicken-\npox are caused by the same virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV).\nThe shingles vaccine (Zostavax), a live vaccine given as a single injection, is recommended for \nadults age ≥60, whether they have already had shingles or not. Some people report a chickenpox-\nlike rash after receiving it. The vaccine should not be given to the following individuals:\n• Those with a weakened immune system due to HIV/AIDS or another disease that \naffects the immune system\n• Those who are receiving immune system-suppressing drugs or treatments, such as \nsteroids, adalimumab (Humira), infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), radiation \nor chemotherapy\n• Those who have neoplasia, which affects the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such \nas leukemia or lymphoma\nClinical Recall\nIn which of the following patients will the vaccination have the greatest \nbenefit?\nA.

    "page_15": "8\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nSMOKING \nA 25-year-old man comes to the clinic for evaluation of a stuffy nose and fever. \nOver the course of the interview, the patient states that he smokes 3 packs of \ncigarettes per day and has been doing so for the last 7 years.\nSmoking is responsible for 1 in every 5 deaths in the United States. Smoking cessation is the \nmost preventable cause of disease. Physicians can take the following steps to assist:\n• ASK  about smoking at every visit.\n• ADVISE  all smokers to quit at every visit.\n• ATTEMPT  to identify those smokers willing to quit.\n• ASSIST  the patient by setting a quit date (usually within 2 weeks) and using nicotine \npatches/gum, the oral antidepressant bupropion or varenicline as  supportive therapy. \nVarenicline and bupropion are more effective than patches.\n• ARRANGE  follow-up. If the quit attempt was successful, then provide positive \nreinforcement. If it was not successful, then determine why the patient smoked and \nelicit a recommitment to smoking cessation. Most patients require several attempts \nbefore being successful.\nMonotherapy treatment for smoking cessation includes nicotine replacement therapy (trans -\ndermal nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers), bupropion, and varenicline. \n• Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold so do not use in cases of alcohol abuse. \n• Varenicline causes an increased rate of suicidal thoughts, so first screen for depression.\nPlace a follow-up call 1–2 weeks after quit date. The use of pharmacotherapy doubles the effect \nof any tobacco cessation intervention.\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nAll women age >65 should be given DEXA bone density scan. Screening should begin at age \n60 if there is low body weight or increased risk of fractures. A bone density test uses x-rays to \nmeasure how many grams of calcium and other bone minerals are packed into a segment of \nbone. The bones that are tested are typically the spine, hip and forearm. Bone density test \nresults are reported in 2 numbers: T-score and Z-score.\nThe T-score  is the bone density compared with what is normally expected in a healthy young \nadult of the same sex. The T-score is the number of units—standard deviations—that bone \ndensity is above or below the average. \n• T-score >2.5 SD indicates the likelihood of osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture. \n• The diagnosis of osteoporosis by DEXA scan also means that treatment should be \ninitiated with bisphosphonates, oral daily calcium supplementation, and vitamin D.\nThe Z-score  is the number of standard deviations above or below what is normally expected \nfor someone of the same age, sex, weight, and ethnic or racial origin. \n• Z-score ≤-2 may suggest that something other than aging is causing abnormal bone \nloss (consider drugs causing osteoporosis such as corticosteroids).\n• The goal in this case is to identify the underlying problem.Note\nDo not use varenicline in \npatients with a history of \npsychiatric disease.\n01_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch01.indd   8 16/05/19   10:29 AM",

Five years ago \nhis mother was diagnosed with diabetes and high cholesterol. He is worried about \nhis health and risk for heart disease. Physical examination is within normal limits.\nCholesterol screening should commence at age 35 in men who have no risk factors for coronary \nartery disease. In both men and women with risk factors, screening should be done routinely after \nage 20. Management should not be determined by an isolated reading because cholesterol levels \nmay fluctuate between measurements. Repeat in 5 years in low-risk individuals.\nScreening for diabetes mellitus should be considered only for patients with hypertension \n(>135/80 mm Hg). Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed in either of these situations:\n• Two fasting glucose measurements are >125 mg/dL, HbA1c >6.5% \n• Random glucose >200 mg/dL accompanied by symptoms\nThere is insufficient evidence for or against routine screening.

The examination reveals galactorrhea but is otherwise normal.\nExcess prolactin secretion is a common clinical problem in women and causes the syndrome of \ngalactorrhea-amenorrhea. The amenorrhea appears to be caused by inhibition of hypothalamic \nrelease of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) with a decrease in luteinizing hormone \n(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. Prolactin inhibits the LH surge that Note\nCabergoline is used more \noften than bromocriptine \nbecause of a better side-effect \nprofile.

The LH/FSH-producing cells are not destroyed, just suppressed. \nAlthough hyperprolactinemia is also seen in men, gynecomastia and especially galactorrhea \nare very rare. The most common presenting symptom in men is erectile dysfunction and \ndecreased libido. \nHyperprolactinemia can be seen in natural physiologic states such as pregnancy, early nursing, \nhypoglycemia, seizure, exercise, stress, sleep, cirrhosis, nipple stimulation, and chronic renal \nfailure (due to PRL clearance).\nAutonomous production of prolactin occurs with pituitary adenomas; these so-called prolacti-\nnomas are the most common functioning pituitary adenomas, accounting for 60% of all \npituitary tumors. They are usually microadenomas when they occur in women and macroad-\nenomas in men, usually presenting with visual field deficits, etc. Macroadenomas can obstruct \nthe pituitary stalk, increasing prolactin release by blocking dopamine transport from hypo-\nthalamus (stalk effect). Other examples are tumors such as craniopharyngioma, meningioma, \nand dysgerminoma; empty sella; and trauma.\nHyperprolactinemia can also occur with decreased inhibitory action of dopamine. This  occurs \nwith the use of drugs that block dopamine synthesis (phenothiazines, metoclopramide) and \ndopamine-depleting agents (α-methyldopa, reserpine). Tricyclic antidepressants, narcotics, \ncocaine, SSRIs, and risperidone can also cause increased prolactin.\nStimuli that overcome the normal dopamine inhibition can also lead to hyperprolactinemia. \nAn example of this is primary hypothyroidism (resulting in an increase in thyrotropin-  \nreleasing hormone [TRH]) and subsequently an increase in prolactin release.\nAlways check TSH in patients with elevated prolactin.\nClinical Presentation. Hyperprolactinemia presents with galactorrhea, menstrual abnormali-\nties amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea, osteopenia and osteoporosis in long-standing cases, \ninfertility, and gynecomastia in women; men present with hypogonadism, erectile dysfunction, \ndecreased libido, gynecomastia, and infertility. Men typically do not develop galactorrhea. \nWomen are detected earlier because of menstrual symptoms. Hence, microadenomas are more \ncommon in women.\nDiagnosis.

    "page_23": "16\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nAcromegaly is caused by a pituitary adenoma (usually macroadenoma in 75% of the cases that \nproduce GH). Rarely ectopic tumors can produce growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) \nand cause this syndrome. Less than 1% are malignant. GH is produced by 20% of pituitary tumors.\nClinical Findings.  GH excess occurs most frequently around decades 3–5. The following \nfindings may be seen.\n• Various skeletal and soft tissue changes\n• Enlargement of the hands and feet, coarsening of facial features, and thickened skin \nfolds; increase in shoe, hat, glove, and ring size\n• Enlarged nose and mandible (prognathism and separation of teeth), sometimes \ncausing underbite\n• Deeper voice\n• Increased sweating\n• Obstructive sleep apnea\n• Enlarged internal organs, including heart, lung, spleen, liver, and kidneys\n• Interstitial edema, osteoarthritis, and entrapment neuropathy (carpal tunnel syn -\ndrome)\n• Menstrual problems (common) due to co-secretion of prolactin by GH-producing \ntumor\n• Cardiac anomalies (10–20%) such as hypertension, arrhythmia, hypertrophic cardio -\nmyopathy, and accelerated atherosclerosis\n• Metabolic changes, i.e., impaired glucose tolerance (80%) and diabetes (13–20%) \n• Hypertension (35%)\n• Headaches and visual field loss\n• Proliferated articular cartilage, causing severe joint disease\nDiagnosis.  Patients with acromegaly have symptoms for ~9 years before the diagnosis is made. \nThe best initial test is IGF-1 level, which is significantly elevated. The confirmatory test is GH \nmeasurement after 100 g of glucose is given orally; if GH remains high (>5 ng/mL), it is positive \nand suggests acromegaly. Normally, glucose load should  completely suppress levels of GH.\nMeasurement of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) or somatomedin correlates with disease activity.\nRadiologic studies such as MTI and CT are used to localize the tumor but should be done only \nafter GH excess is documented biochemically.  MRI is superior to CT in that it will show a \ntumor in 90% of people with acromegaly.\nManagement.  The objectives are to decrease GH levels to normal, stabilize or decrease tumor \nsize, and preserve normal pituitary function. Transsphenoidal surgery provides a rapid \nresponse. Hypopituitarism can result in 10–20%. Primary treatment is surgery.\nSomatostatin analogues are the drugs of choice. Octreotide and lanreotide reduce GH values \n(70% of patients) and cause partial tumor regression (20–50% of patients). Octreotide is the \nbest medical therapy for acromegaly. The main side effect of concern with somatostatin \nanalogues is cholestasis, leading to cholecystitis.Note\nThe most common cause of \ndeath in acromegaly is \ncardiovascular mortality.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   16 16/05/19   10:32 AM",

Important to note, pegvisomant is a \n second-line agent.\nRadiotherapy, used only if surgery and drug therapy do not work, results in slow resolution of \ndisease and hypopituitarism in 20% of patients.\nComplications of acromegaly can arise from pressure of the tumor on the surrounding \nstructures or invasion of the tumor into the brain or sinuses. Other complications include \ncardiac failure  (most common cause of death in acromegaly), diabetes mellitus, cord com-\npression, and visual field defects.\nHypopituitarism\nHypopituitarism is partial or complete loss of anterior function that results from any lesion \nwhich destroys the pituitary or hypothalamus or which interferes with the delivery of  releasing \nand inhibiting factors to the anterior hypothalamus. GH and gonadotropins (FSH, LH) are \ntypically lost early.\nLarge pituitary tumors, or cysts, as well as hypothalamic tumors (craniopharyngiomas, \n meningiomas, gliomas) can lead to hypopituitarism. Pituitary adenomas are the most  common \ncause of panhypopituitarism; the mass compresses the gland, causing pressure, trauma, and \nnecrosis.\nPituitary apoplexy is a syndrome associated with acute hemorrhagic infarction of a  preexisting \npituitary adenoma and manifests as severe headache, nausea or vomiting, and  depression of \nconsciousness. It is a medical and neurosurgical emergency.\nInflammatory diseases can lead to hypopituitarism: granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis, \ntuberculosis [TB], syphilis), eosinophilic granuloma, and autoimmune lymphocytic hypo -\nphysitis (usually associated with other autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and \ngastric atrophy). Trauma, radiation, surgery, infections, and hypoxia may also damage both the \npituitary and hypothalamus.\nVascular diseases such as Sheehan postpartum necrosis  (initial sign being the inability to \nlactate) and infiltrative diseases including hemochromatosis and amyloidosis may induce this \nstate as well.\nStroke can also damage these cells. Stroke can cause central diabetes insipidus due to damage \nof hypothalamus and/or posterior pituitary.\nClinical Findings.  The following hormones appear in the order in which they are lost in \nhypopituitarism.\n• Gonadotropin deficiency (LH and FSH) can occur in women and lead to amenorrhea, \ngenital atrophy, infertility, decreased libido, and loss of axillary and pubic hair.\n• In men, decreased LH and FSH results in impotence, testicular atrophy, infertility, \ndecreased libido, and loss of axillary and pubic hair.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   17 16/05/19   10:32 AM",

GH \ndeficiency gives an asymptomatic increase in lipid levels and a decrease in muscle, \nbone, and heart mass. It also may accelerate atherosclerosis, and it increases visceral \nobesity.\n• GH deficiency in children results in growth failure and short stature.\n• Thyrotropin (TSH) deficiency results in hypothyroidism with fatigue, weakness, \nhyperlipidemia, cold intolerance, and puffy skin without goiter.\n• Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) deficiency occurs last and results in secondary adrenal \ninsufficiency caused by pituitary disease.\n• There is decreased cortisol, which results in fatigue, decreased appetite, weight loss, \ndecreased skin and nipple pigment, and decreased response to stress (as well as fever, \nhypotension, and hyponatremia).\nElectrolyte changes like hyperkalemia and salt loss are minimal in secondary adrenal insuffi-\nciency because aldosterone production is mainly dependent on the renin-angiotensin system. \nACTH deficiency does not result in the salt wasting, hyperkalemia, and death that are associ-\nated with aldosterone deficiency.\nDiagnosis. The first step in diagnosing pituitary insufficiency is to measure GH, TSH, LH, and \nIGF-1. The most reliable stimulus for GH secretion is insulin-induced hypoglycemia. After \ninjecting 0.1 μ/kg of regular insulin, blood glucose declines to <40 mg/dL; in normal conditions \nthat will stimulate GH levels to >10 mg/L and exclude GH deficiency. Random GH and IGF \nlevels are not sensitive enough to diagnose GH deficiency. This is why a provocative test is used.\nArginine infusion can also stimulate growth hormone release. Measure GH levels after \ninfusing arginine. This is less dangerous because it does not lead to hypoglycemia.\nTo diagnose ACTH deficiency, basal cortisol levels may be preserved (the problem could \nbe only in response to stress). Insulin tolerance test is diagnostic and involves giving  0.05–0.1 \nU/kg of regular insulin and measuring serum cortisol; plasma cortisol should increase to >19 \nmg/dL. Metyrapone tests for decreased ACTH production. Metyrapone blocks cortisol \nproduction, which should increase ACTH levels. A failure of ACTH levels to rise after giving \nmetyrapone would indicate pituitary insufficiency. Cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation may give \nabnormally low cortisol output if pituitary insufficiency has led to adrenal atrophy.\nTo diagnose gonadotropin deficiency in women, measure LH, FSH, and estrogen. In males, \nmeasure LH, FSH, and testosterone. To diagnose TSH deficiency, measure serum thyroxine \n(T4) and free triiodothyronine (T3), which are low, with a normal to low TSH.\nManagement.  Management of hypopituitarism involves treating the underlying causes. \nMultiple hormones must be replaced, but the most important is cortisol.\nEmpty Sella Syndrome (ESS)\nESS is in the differential diagnosis of enlarged sella caused by pituitary tumors. In ESS, the sella \nhas no bony erosion. It is caused by herniation of the suprasellar subarachnoid space through \nan incomplete diaphragma sellae. No pituitary gland is visible on CT or MRI. The syndrome \ncan be primary (idiopathic) and is also associated with head trauma and radiation therapy. \nMost patients with these syndromes are  obese , multiparous women with headaches ; 30% will \nhave hypertension.

Lab studies include the following:\n• Decreased TSH (but elevated TSH in secondary hyperthyroidism)\n• High serum free T4 and T3\n• Elevated RAIU (but decreased RAIU in subacute thyroiditis and factitious \n hyperthyroidism)\n• Elevated TSI, antithyroglobulin, and antimicrosomal antibodies\nTreatment involves relief of symptoms and correction of the thyrotoxic state. Treat adrenergic \nhyperfunction with beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol). Correct the high thyroid hor -\nmone levels with an anti-thyroid medication (methimazole or propylthiouracil), which blocks \nthe synthesis of thyroid hormones and/or by treatment with radioactive iodine. \n• Methimazole has a longer half-life, reverses hyperthyroidism more quickly, and has \nfewer side effects than propylthiouracil.\n• Methimazole requires an average of 6 weeks to lower T4 levels to normal and is often \ngiven before radioactive iodine treatment; it can be taken 1x/ day.\n• Use propylthiouracil only when methimazole is not appropriate because of its poten -\ntial for liver damage; it must be taken 2−3x/ day.\nFor years propylthiouracil was the traditional drug of choice during  pregnancy  because it \ncauses fewer severe birth defects than methimazole. However, experts now recommend that \npropylthiouracil be given during the first trimester only. This is because there have been rare \ncases of liver damage in people taking propylthiouracil. After the first trimester, women should \nswitch to methimazole for the rest of the pregnancy. \nFor women who are nursing, methimazole is probably a better choice than propylthiouracil (to \navoid liver side effects).

About 98% of calcium is \nstored in bone. Calcium is absorbed from the proximal portion of the small intestine, particularly \nthe duodenum. About 80% of an ingested calcium load in the diet is lost in the feces, unabsorbed. \nOf the 2% of calcium that is circulating in blood, free calcium is 50%, protein bound is 40%, \nwith only 10% bound to citrate or phosphate buffers.\nThe most common cause of hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism ; it is  usually \nasymptomatic and is found as a result of routine testing. Hypercalcemia due to malignancy is \ncaused by a PTH-like protein produced by squamous cell carcinoma of the lung or metastatic \ndisease to the bone. Granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, berylliosis, \nhistoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis are all associated with hypercalcemia.

Hyperthyroidism is associated with hypercalcemia \n because there is a partial effect of thyroid hormone on osteoclasts. Acidosis results in an \n increased amount of free calcium. This is because albumin buffers acidosis. Increased binding \nof hydrogen ions to albumin results in the displacement of calcium from albumin.\nFamilial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)  is a benign form of hypercalcemia. It presents \nwith mild hypercalcemia, family history of hypercalcemia, urine calcium to creatinine ratio \n<0.01, and urine calcium <200 mg/day (hypocalciuria). Most cases are associated with loss of \nfunction mutations in the CaSR gene, which encodes a calcium sensing receptor (expressed in \nkidney and parathyroid tissue). The perceived lack of calcium levels by the parathyroid leads to \nhigh levels of parathyroid hormone. FHH is indicated by the presence of hypercalcemia at the \nsame time with hypocalciuria.

GI manifestations \ninclude anorexia, weight loss, constipation, nausea, vomiting, thirst, abdominal pain with \npancreatitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Cardiovascular findings include hypertension and arrhyth -\nmias (short QT).\nDiagnosis.  Lab findings will include serum calcium >10.5 mg/dL, with elevated PTH. Urine \ncalcium elevation is common, but because of the calcium-reabsorbing action of PTH, 35% of \npatients may have normal levels. Serum phosphate is usually low (<2.5 mg/dL). The differential \ndiagnosis includes all other causes of hypercalcemia, especially hypercalcemia of malignancy. \nIn every other cause of hypercalcemia, the PTH level will be low. In primary hyperparathy-\nroidism, PTH is always elevated.\nImaging studies such as CT, MRI, sonography, and nuclear scan are not used to diagnose \nhyperparathyroidism.

The elevated PTH then \ncauses elevated serum calcium and low serum phosphate.\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism  is due to physiologic (i.e., appropriate ) secretion of PTH by \nthe parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia (resulting vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney \ndisease, etc.). Serum calcium level is low (that is what causes the elevated PTH) and serum phosphate \nis low (because of elevated PTH). In the case of chronic kidney failure and anuria, the phosphate—in \nthis form of secondary hyperparathyroidism—is elevated (the kidney is unable to ‘trash’ phosphate).\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism  is seen with long-term secondary hyperparathyroidism , which \ncan lead to hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands and a loss of response to serum calcium levels. It is \nmost often seen in patients with chronic renal failure, and is an autonomous activity of the parathyroid \nglands. Treatment is sometimes surgical removal.\nHypocalcemia\nHypocalcemia is most commonly caused by hypoparathyroidism, renal failure, \nhyperphosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia. Drugs such as loop diuretics, phenytoin, \nalendronate, and foscarnet will also lower calcium levels. Renal failure causes hypocalcemia \nbecause of the loss of activated 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D. This leads to decreased calcium \nabsorption from the gut. In addition, hyperphosphatemia will cause the precipitation of \ncalcium in  tissues. Low magnesium levels from malnutrition of alcoholism prevent the release \nof parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid glands. Alkalosis decreases free calcium levels by \ncausing increased binding of calcium to albumin. Pseudo hypocalcemia occurs with low \nalbumin levels. The free calcium level remains normal, while the total calcium level decreases.\nTo correct for albumin, add 0.8 to calcium level for every 1 gram below 4 of albumin.  Massive \nblood transfusion gives hypocalcemia because of binding of the calcium to the  citrate in the \ntransfused units of blood.\nClinical Findings. Hypocalcemia results in increased neural hyperexcitability such as  seizures, \ntetany, circumoral numbness, and tingling of the extremities. Arrhythmias may  develop \nbecause of a prolonged QT. Cataracts develop for unclear reasons.\nTreatment of hypocalcemia is IV or oral calcium replacement, and vitamin D replacement as \nnecessary. \nHypoparathyroidism\nThe most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is surgical removal of the thyroid. Low PTH \nlevels are also seen in hereditary hypoparathyroidism, acquired hypoparathyroidism (surgical \nremoval), and hypomagnesemia. \nMagnesium deficiency prevents release of PTH from the gland. Hypomagnesemia occurs from \ndecreased GI absorption or alcoholism. High PTH levels are seen in chronic renal failure, and \ndecreased levels of active vitamin D, which is caused by decreased dietary  intake or defective \nmetabolism (secondary to anticonvulsant therapy or vitamin D-  dependent rickets, type I). \n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   38 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

Low or ineffective vitamin D is also associated with \nlow calcium levels.\nClinical Findings.  Clinical findings depend on the level of calcium, duration, acid-base \ndisorder, and age at onset of disease.\n• Neuromuscular irritability: tetany, laryngospasm, cramping, seizures, impaired \nmemory function \n• Possible positive Chvostek sign (percussion of the facial nerve in front of ear, which \nelicits a contraction of facial muscles and upper lip) \n• Possible positive Trousseau sign (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on arm to a \npressure higher than patient’s systolic pressure for 3 min elicits flexion of the metacar -\npophalangeal joints and extension of interphalangeal joints) \n• Ocular findings: cataracts, soft tissue calcifications\n• Possible cardiovascular effects: QT prolongation, refractory CHF, and/or hypotension\nHypocalcemia frequently causes circumoral tingling as well as tingling of the hands and feet. \nHyperventilation worsens symptoms of hypocalcemia because the alkalosis decreases free \ncalcium levels.\nDiagnosis is suggested when serum calcium is low; it is important to check  albumin  and make \nthe correction in calcium level. A low calcium may be due to low albumin; for a 1.0 g/dL drop in \nalbumin, total calcium will decrease by 0.8 mg/dL. It is better to measure ionized calcium. \nDepending on the etiology, PTH can be low (hypoparathyroidism) or high. Low calcium with \nhigh phosphorous can be due to renal failure, massive tissue destruction, hypoparathyroidism, \nand pseudohypoparathyroidism. Low calcium with low phosphorous is due to absent or \nineffective vitamin D.\nManagement.  In the acute stage of hypocalcemia, give IV calcium gluconate. Maintenance \ntherapy includes oral calcium 2–4 g/d, vitamin D, and if there is hyperphosphatemia, diet \nrestriction and phosphate binders (CaCO3 or aluminum hydroxide).\nClinical Recall\nWhich of the following is a clear indication for surgery in a patient with \nprimary hyperparathyroidism?\nA.

DM affects approximately 6% of the \npopulation in the United States, and approaches 20% of patients over age 65.\nClassification\n• Type 1 IDDM (insulin- dependent or juvenile onset)  accounts for 5–10% of diabetes \nworldwide, with males = females. The age of onset is usually age <30. Genetically, <10% \nof first-degree relatives are affected with a 50% occurrence in identical twins.\n• There is an increased prevalence of autoantibodies to islet cells, glutamic acid decar -\nboxylase (GAD), and other tissues with IDDM. Type 1 diabetes is associated with \nHLA-B8, HLA-B15, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DR4. Patients usually have a lean body build \nand are prone to ketosis owing to absent insulin production.\n• Type 2, or NIDDM (non-insulin -dependent or maturity onset) , is the most common \ntype of diabetes, accounting for 90% of cases, with males >females. Age of onset is \nusually age 40. Genetically >20% of first-degree relatives are affected with 90–100% \noccurrence in identical twins.\n• No autoantibodies are associated with NIDDM. The body build of these patients is \nusually obese with >80% being >15% above ideal body weight. NIDDM patients are \nketosis-resistant, and insulin levels may be high, normal, or low. About 90% of \ndiabetes is type 2.\nFor IDDM, by the time the condition appears, most of the beta cells in the pancreas have been \ndestroyed. The destructive process is most likely autoimmune in nature.\nFor NIDDM, there are 2 clear physiologic defects: abnormal insulin secretion and resistance to \ninsulin action in target tissues.\nClinical Findings.  Manifestations of symptomatic DM vary from patient to patient. Most \noften symptoms are associated with hyperglycemia, and polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia \ncan be seen. The first event may be an acute metabolic decompensation, resulting in coma \n(ketoacidosis for IDDM and hyperosmolar coma for NIDDM). Occasionally the initial \nexpression of DM is a degenerative complication like neuropathy.\nDiagnosis.  Symptomatic patients will have polyuria, polydipsia, ketonuria, and weight loss. \nPlasma glucose >200 mg/dL in these patients is sufficient for diagnosis with no further testing \nneeded. A random glucose >200 mg/dL is diagnostic.\nIn asymptomatic patients, an elevated plasma or urine glucose during routine screening does \nnot establish diagnosis but indicates a need for further evaluation. Patients who have DM will \nhave a fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL on 2 occasions. The oral glucose tolerance test is \nrarely required. DM is diagnosed when plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL at 2 h and on at least one \nof the earlier samples. HbA1c >6.5% is diagnostic of diabetes.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   40 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

It is used both for \ndiagnosis and to follow compliance of the treatment and glucose control in diabetic patients. \nHbA1c is high in diabetics with chronic hyperglycemia during the preceding 8–12 weeks.\nManagement.  The objectives of diabetic therapy are to control symptoms, prevent acute \ncomplications, and limit long-term complications. Several steps should be considered, such as \npatient education, weight loss, low-fat diet, physical activity, and pharmacologic therapy with \noral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin.\nWeight reduction of as little as 4–7% body fat has an enormous effect on peripheral insulin \nsensitivity and on reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia. Exercise lowers glucose levels. \nExercising muscle needs no insulin for glucose to enter. Resting muscle, in comparison, needs \ninsulin for glucose entry. As many as 25% of diabetic patients can be kept off of medication \nwith diet and exercise alone.\nThe effects of diet, exercise, and weight loss can last for many years. When diet and exercise do \nnot keep the HbA1c <7%, medications are introduced.\nOral hypoglycemics should be prescribed for all type 2 diabetics. Metformin is the drug of \nchoice and along with lifestyle intervention should be used in all newly diagnosed patients. One \nmajor advantage of metformin is that it does not cause hypoglycemia. Another is that it does \nnot cause weight gain. (Metformin is contraindicated in those with renal insufficiency.)\n• If a patient is initiated on metformin yet the diabetes does not become well-  controlled, \nadd a sulfonylurea.\n• If a patient is already on sulfonylurea but the diabetes is not well-controlled, add \nmetformin.\n• If a patient is already taking both metformin and a sulfonylurea yet there is still poor \nglycemic control, then either switch to insulin or add a glitazone.\n –Glitazones can lead to fluid retention.\n –If one drug is not sufficient, a second or third oral agent may be combined to keep \nthe patient off insulin.\n• If metformin cannot be used, use a new glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) agonist \n(exenatide or liraglutide). GLP-1 agonists are second-line agents that can be added to \nmetformin or used individually if metformin cannot be used.\nIn all cases, metformin is clearly the “best initial therapy” for type 2 diabetes.

The problem with these drugs is that they must be \ngiven by injection. They have an outstanding effect on slowing gastric motility and promoting \nweight loss, but because they are given by injection they are not used as one of the first three \nclasses of medications to treat type 2 diabetes.\nThe other incretin is “glucagon-like peptide” or GLP . Though “glucagon-like, ” GLP does not raise \nglucose levels  or mimic the effect on glucagon in terms of breaking down glycogen or increasing \ngluconeogenesis. The term “glucagon-like peptide” is very confusing because the effect of GLP is \nstrictly to LOWER glucose levels. GLP also raises insulin levels and slows gastric motility.

Acidosis can \nresult in fatal rhythm disturbance.\nThe diagnosis of DKA can be made by finding elevated blood glucose, increased serum levels \nof acetoacetate, acetone, and hydroxybutyrate, metabolic acidosis (low serum bicarbonate and \nlow blood pH), and increased anion gap (sodium – [bicarbonate + chloride]). DKA is man-\naged with insulin, fluids, and electrolyte replacement. Normal saline should be given in high \nvolume with insulin replacement. Bolus with 5–10 units of regular insulin. Acutely, DKA is \nassociated with hyperkalemia. The total body level of potassium is depleted because of the \nurinary loss of potassium. As soon as the potassium level falls to ≤5 mEq/L, potassium replace -\nment should be given.\nClinical points in the management of DKA\n• Begin management with IV insulin, then switch to subcutaneous insulin when the \nanion gap normalizes and serum bicarbonate levels are normal.\n• Do not stop the IV insulin before starting subcutaneous insulin; instead, overlap them \nboth for 6−8 hours.\n• Add 5% dextrose to the normal saline as blood glucose reaches 200−250 mg/dL, and \ncontinue IV insulin until the anion gap normalizes.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   44 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

Precipitating factors include noncompliance with treatment plus the  inability to drink \nsufficient water to keep up with urinary losses. This is common in elderly diabetics living in \nnursing homes. Infections, strokes, steroids, immunosuppressant agents, and diuretics are other \nprecipitating factors. HONK can occur after a therapeutic procedure such as peritoneal/hemodi -\nalysis, tube feeding of high-protein formulas, or high-  carbohydrate  infusion. The pathophysiol -\nogy involved is profound dehydration resulting from a sustained hyperglycemic diuresis. Clinical \nfindings are weakness, polyuria,  polydipsia, lethargy,  confusion, convulsions, and coma.\nThe diagnosis of HONK is suggested by elevated blood glucose (typically ≥700 mg/dL) and \nextremely high serum osmolality.\nSerum osmolality in mOsm/L  = 2[sodium] + [glucose/18] + [BUN/2.8]\nA high BUN (prerenal azotemia) and mild metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate ~20 mEq/L) is also \nseen without ketosis.\nManagement of HONK involves high-volume fluid and electrolyte replacement, and insulin.\nChronic Complications. Chronic complications of diabetes involve the macro- and microvas-\nculature, and are a major result of disease progression. These complications reduce  patients’ \nquality of life, incur heavy burdens to the health care system, and increase diabetic mortality. \nMicrovascular disease of diabetes includes diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. \nMacrovascular disease contains coronary artery disease, peripheral  arterial disease, and stroke. \nThe effect of glycemic control is much more evident on the morbidity and mortality associated \nwith microvascular complications.\nCardiovascular Complications. The number 1 cause of death in patients with diabetes is \ncardiovascular disease. About 75% of all deaths in diabetes are from myocardial infarction, \ncongestive failure, or stroke. The central pathological mechanism in macrovascular disease is \natherosclerosis, which leads to narrowing of arterial walls throughout the body. Atherosclero-\nsis is thought to result from chronic inflammation and injury to the arterial wall in the \nperipheral or coronary vascular system.\nLipid testing should be performed in patients with diabetes at least annually. Diabetes is con -\nsidered the equivalent of coronary disease in terms of management of hyperlipidemia. Lipid \ngoals for adults with diabetes are as follows:\n• LDL <100 mg/dL (or <70 mg/dL in cases of overt CVD)\n• HDL >50 mg/dL\n• Fasting triglycerides <150 mg/dL\n• If LDL >100 mg/dL, patient should implement lifestyle modification (diet, exercise) \nalong with drug therapy (statin). Combination therapy of statin plus another drug \nsuch as a fibrate or niacin may be necessary to achieve ideal lipid control, but monitor \npatients closely for possible adverse reaction to therapy.\n• Coronary artery bypass should be performed in a diabetic patient even if there is only \n2-vessel coronary disease.\nDiabetic nephropathy. Nephropathy affects 30–40% of type 1 diabetics and 20–30% of type 2 \ndiabetics. Hyperproliferation, proteinuria, and end-stage renal disease can develop. The pathology \ncan be diffuse, which is more common, and lead to widening of glomerular basement membrane Note\nThe most common pattern of \ndyslipidemia in patients with \ntype 2 diabetes is elevated \ntriglyceride and decreased \nHDL cholesterol.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   45 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

Nodular pathology can occur and results in hyalinization of afferent \nglomerular arterioles (Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome). Management of nephropathy involves \nstrict control of diabetes, ACE-inhibitors, and dialysis or renal transplantation.\nAll diabetics should be screened for proteinuria annually. Proteinuria is detectable on a standard \ndipstick when the level >300 mg per 24 hours. Microalbuminuria  is defined as a level 30–300 mg. \nAll those with proteinuria should receive therapy with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor \nblocker. Diabetes is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States.\nDiabetic retinopathy. The retina is affected, and diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in \nmiddle-aged patients. Simple/background, or proliferative (microaneurysms, hemorrhages, \nexudates, retinal edema) damage can occur.\n• For type 2 diabetic patients, screen at diagnosis, then annually.\n• For type 1 diabetes, the first screening should take place 5 years after diagnosis, then \nannually.\nProliferative retinopathy is defined as the presence of vitreous hemorrhages or neovasculariza-\ntion; treatment is with laser photocoagulation. Nonproliferative or background retinopathy \ncan only be prevented with tight control of glucose levels.\nDiabetic neuropathy. Neuropathy is another complication of diabetes, and it has various types.\n• Peripheral neuropathy  (most common) is symmetrical, with symptoms of numbness, \nparesthesia, and pain being prevalent. Physical exam reveals absent reflexes and loss \nof vibratory sense. Podiatric exam (monofilament testing) should occur annually to \nlook for early signs of neuropathy since it leads to increased injury from trauma. \nDiabetes is responsible for 50% of all nontraumatic amputations in the United States.\n• Mononeuropathy  affects a single nerve or nerve trunk (mononeuritis multiplex) and \nis vascular in origin; patients will have sudden foot drop, wrist drop, or paralysis of \nCN III, IV, or VI.\n• Autonomic neuropathy  can be devastating; patients will have orthostatic hypotension \nand syncope as main manifestations. Gastrointestinally, patients may have difficulty \nswallowing, delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis), constipation, or diarrhea. The \ndiagnostic test of choice for gastroparesis is the gastric emptying scintigraphy study. \nBladder dysfunction or paralysis can lead to urinary retention. Impotence and \nretrograde ejaculation can occur; the prevalence of erectile dysfunction is as high as \n50% in patients with 10 years of diabetes.\nWikimedia, Jonathan Moore\nFigure 2-12.

Management once it occurs depends on the type. For peripheral neuropathy, \nanalgesics, gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline, and carbamazepine are used  (gabapentin and \npregabalin are the best). For gastroparesis, metoclopramide or erythromycin can be used. \nErectile dysfunction is treated with sildenafil and similar drugs.\nAdditional Concepts.  The “honeymoon” period (in IDDM patients) is an initial episode of \nketoacidosis followed by a symptom-free interval during which no treatment is required. Presum -\nably stress-induced epinephrine release blocks insulin secretion, causing the syndrome. In normal \nindividuals insulin reserve is such that hormone release is adequate even in the face of stress.\nThe Somogyi effect is rebound hyperglycemia in the morning because of counterregulatory \nhormone release after an episode of hypoglycemia in the middle of the night.\nThe Dawn phenomenon is an early morning rise in plasma glucose secondary to a rise in \ncounter-regulatory hormones cortisol, epinephrine, and GH requiring increased amounts of \ninsulin to maintain euglycemia.\nHypoglycemia\nGlucose is the primary energy source of the brain. Symptoms of hypoglycemia are divided  \ninto 2 groups and can occur because of excessive secretion of epinephrine, leading to sweat -\ning, tremor, tachycardia, anxiety, and hunger. Hypoglycemia can also occur because of \ndysfunction of the CNS, leading to dizziness, headache, clouding vision, blunted mental \nactivity, loss of fine motor skills, confusion, abnormal behavior, convulsions, and loss of \nconsciousness. There is no uniform correlation between a given level of blood sugar and \nsymptoms. Major symptoms in normal persons may not be seen until blood sugar is \n20 mg/dL.\nClassification.  Postprandial hypoglycemia (reactive) can be secondary to alimentary hyperin-\nsulinism (after gastrectomy, gastrojejunostomy, pyloroplasty, or vagotomy), idiopathic, and \ngalactosemia.\nFasting hypoglycemia can result from conditions in which there is an underproduction of \nglucose, such as hormone deficiencies (panhypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency), enzyme \ndefects, substrate deficiency (severe malnutrition, late pregnancy), acquired liver disease, or \ndrugs (alcohol, propanolol, salicylates). Fasting hypoglycemia can also occur in conditions \nrelated to overutilization of glucose such as hyperinsulinism. Hyperinsulinism can occur \nsecondary to insulinoma, exogenous insulin, sulfonylureas, drugs (quinine), endotoxic shock, \nand immune disease with insulin receptor antibodies. Overutilization of glucose can also \noccur in states in which there are appropriate insulin levels, such as extrapancreatic tumors \nand rare enzyme deficiencies.\nInsulinoma  (pancreatic B-cell tumor) can cause hypoglycemia. Ninety percent of these  tumors \nare single and benign. Clinical findings include symptoms of subacute or chronic hypoglycemia \nsuch as blurred vision, headache, feelings of detachment, slurred speech, and weakness. \nSymptoms occur in the early morning or late afternoon or after fasting or exercise.\nDiagnosis.  This is made by finding a serum insulin level ≥8 mg/mL in the presence of blood \nglucose <40 mg/dL (i.e., inappropriately high serum insulin level when glucose is low), noted \neither spontaneously or during a prolonged fast (72 hours). CT scan, U/S, and arteriography \nmay also be useful in detecting the tumor(s). Management of insulinoma is by surgery, diet, \nand medical therapy.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   47 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

Adrenal Cortex Regions\nHyperfunctioning of the Gland\nCushing syndrome\nCushing syndrome is a group of clinical abnormalities caused by prolonged exposure to \n increased amounts of cortisol or related corticosteroids. The most common causes are \n exogenous, iatrogenic, and those secondary to prolonged use of glucocorticoids.\nThe etiology of Cushing syndrome includes adrenal hyperplasia. This can be secondary to \npituitary ACTH production, which occurs in pituitary-hypothalamic dysfunction, and \n pituitary ACTH-producing adenomas (microadenoma, e.g., Cushing disease). ACTH-  \nproducing pituitary adenomas cause about 60–80% of Cushing cases. Adrenal hyperplasia can \nalso be secondary to ACTH or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), produced by nonen-\ndocrine tumors (bronchogenic carcinoma, carcinoma of the thymus, pancreatic  carcinoma, \nand bronchial adenoma). Adrenal neoplasia, such as adenoma or carcinoma, and adrenal \nnodular hyperplasia account for about 30% of Cushing cases. Excessive cortisol production by \nan autonomous adrenal tumor results in a low ACTH level. About 15% of Cushing cases are \nfrom ACTH from a source that cannot be located.\nClinical Findings.  The clinical findings of Cushing syndrome include deposition of adipose \ntissue in characteristic sites such as upper fat, moon facies; interscapular buffalo hump; and \nmesenteric bed, truncal obesity. Other clinical findings include hypertension , muscle weakness, \nand fatigability related to mobilization of peripheral supportive tissue; osteoporosis caused by \nincreased bone catabolism; cutaneous striae; and easy bruisability.  Women may have acne, \nhirsutism, and oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea resulting from the increased adrenal androgen \nsecretion. Emotional changes range from irritability or emotional lability to severe depression \nor confusion; even psychosis can occur as well. Glucose intolerance is common in Cushing \ndisease, with 20% of patients having diabetes.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   49 16/05/19   10:33 AM",
    "page_57": "50\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nCushing and glucocorticoid use are also associated with hypokalemia and leukocytosis. \nHypokalemia occurs because of the mineralocorticoid effect of the steroids.\nClinically significant hypokalemia is uncommon.\nOther manifestations are delayed wound healing, renal calculi from increased calcium levels, \nand glaucoma. Polyuria is from hyperglycemia. There is increased susceptibility to  infections \nbecause neutrophils exhibit diminished function because of high glucocorticoid levels.\nDiagnosis. The diagnostic tests used to establish the syndrome of cortisol excess are the 1-mg \novernight dexamethasone suppression test and the 24-hour urine-free cortisol. The tests used \nto establish a precise etiology of the cortisol excess are the ACTH level, high-dose dexametha-\nsone suppression test, CT and MRI scanning, and occasionally sampling of the petrosal venous \nsinus, which drains out of the pituitary.\nThe 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test is used to rule out the diagnosis of Cushing \nsyndrome or glucocorticoid excess. If you give a milligram of dexamethasone at 11  p.m., the \ncortisol level at 8 a.m. should come to normal if there is the normal ability to suppress ACTH \nproduction over several hours. The problem with this test is that there can be falsely abnormal or \npositive tests. Any drug that increases the metabolic breakdown of dexamethasone will prevent \nits ability to suppress cortisol levels. Examples of drugs  increasing the metabolism of dexametha -\nsone are phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin. Stress increases glucocorticoid levels. The \n1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test can be falsely positive in stressful conditions \nsuch as starvation, anorexia, bulimia, alcohol withdrawal, or depression.\nAn abnormality on the 1-mg overnight test should be confirmed with a 24-hour urine-free \ncortisol. The 24-hour urine-free cortisol is more accurate and is the gold standard for confirm-\ning or excluding Cushing’s syndrome.\nA third screening test for Cushing is the midnight salivary cortisol. In normal patients, cortisol is \nat its lowest at midnight. In Cushing patients, cortisol is abnormally elevated at midnight.\nThe precise etiology of the Cushing syndrome is established by using ACTH levels, sometimes \nin combination with high-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. ACTH levels are elevated \nwith either a pituitary source of ACTH such as an adenoma or with an ectopic source. High-\ndose dexamethasone suppression testing can distinguish the difference. The output of a \npituitary adenoma will suppress with high-dose dexamethasone. The output of an ectopic \nsource will not suppress with high-dose dexamethasone.\nIf the ACTH level is low, then the etiology is most likely from an adrenal tumor such as an adeno -\nma, cancer, or from adrenal hyperplasia. When the adrenal gland is the source of  increased cortisol \nproduction, there is feedback inhibition on the pituitary and the ACTH level is suppressed.\nWhen there is a low ACTH level, the precise etiology is confirmed with a CT scan of the adrenals.\nWhen there is a high ACTH level, the precise etiology is confirmed with an MRI of the \n pituitary looking for an adenoma or a CT scan of the chest looking for an ectopic focus. \nIf neither of these shows a lesion or the MRI of the brain is equivocal, then inferior petrosal \nsinus sampling should be done to see if there is increased ACTH coming out of the brain.\nSingle random cortisol levels are not reliable.\n• High plasma ACTH levels = pituitary or ectopic source\n• Low plasma ACTH levels = adrenal tumors or hyperplasia\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   50 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

The normal function of aldosterone is to reabsorb sodium and \nexcrete potassium and acid (H+). Hyperaldosteronism can be divided into the following:\n• Primary  aldosteronism , in which the stimulus for the excessive aldosterone produc -\ntion is within the adrenal gland\n• Secondary aldosteronism , in which the stimulus is extraadrenal\nThe most common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism is a unilateral adrenal adenoma (70%). \nBilateral hyperplasia accounts for 25–30%. Excessive black licorice ingestion can mimic this \neffect. Licorice has aldosterone-like qualities.\nPrimary Aldosteronism Secondary Aldosteronism\n/uni2191 Intravascular\nvolume\nInitiating eventInitiating event\n/uni2191 Aldosterone\nproduction/uni2191 Na+ retention /uni2193 Renin\n–/uni2193 Intravascular\nvolume\n/uni2191 Aldosterone\nproduction/uni2191 Na+ retention /uni2191 Renin\nFigure 2-15.  Mechanism of HyperaldosteronismFigure 2-15. Mechanism of Hyperaldosteronism\nClinical. Primary hyperaldosteronism is characterized by hypertension and low potassium \nlevels. Most of the other symptoms, such as muscle weakness, polyuria, and polydipsia, are \nfrom the hypokalemia. Metabolic alkalosis occurs because aldosterone increases hydrogen ion \n(H+) excretion. Aldosterone causes alkalosis. Edema is uncommon with primary \n hyperaldosteronism because of sodium release into the urine.\nTable 2-7.

A positive screen is a PAC/PRA ratio >20:1 and a \nPAC >15. To confirm hyperaldosteronism, an NaCl challenge is required. This can be via \nnormal saline, NaCl tabs, or fludrocortisone. After an NaCl challenge, PAC should be sup-\npressed as in a normal individual. If PAC is still elevated, this confirms the diagnosis.\nManagement.  Adrenal adenomas are removed surgically. Bilateral hyperplasia is treated with \nspironolactone, which blocks aldosterone.\nBartter Syndrome.  The exception of secondary hyperaldosteronism without edema or \n hypertension is Bartter syndrome. Bartter syndrome is caused by a defect in the loop of Henle \nin which it loses NaCl. This is due to a defect in the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter. This is like having \na furosemide-secreting tumor.\nIn Bartter syndrome there is juxtaglomerular hyperplasia, normal to low blood pressure, no \nedema, severe hypokalemic alkalosis, defect in renal conservation of sodium or chloride, and \nrenal loss of sodium, which stimulates renin secretion and aldosterone production.\nSyndromes of adrenal androgen excess\nSyndromes of adrenal androgen excess result from excess production of dehydroepiandros-\nterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, which are converted to testosterone in extraglandular \ntissues. The elevated testosterone accounts for most androgenic effects.\nClinical Signs and Symptoms.  Hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, acne, and virilization. Etiology \nincludes congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal adenomas (rare), and adrenal carcinomas.\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the most common adrenal disorder of infancy and \nchildhood . It is associated with increased adrenal androgen production because of enzymatic \ndefects. CAH arises from autosomal recessive mutations, which produce deficiencies of \nenzymes necessary for the synthesis of cortisol.\nCommon Enzymatic Defects Associated with CAH.  Enzymatic defects include C-21 \n hydroxylase deficiency in 95% of all cases. C-21 hydroxylase deficiency is associated with \nreduction in aldosterone secretion in one-third of patients. Adrenal virilization occurs with or \nwithout an associated salt-losing tendency, owing to aldosterone deficiency, which leads to \nhyponatremia, hyperkalemia, dehydration, and hypotension.\nPatients are female at birth with ambiguous external genitalia (female pseudohermaphroditism), \nenlarged clitoris, and partial or complete fusion of the labia. Postnatally CAH is  associated with \nvirilization. Patients may be male at birth with macrogenitosomia; postnatally this is associated \nwith precocious puberty.\nC-11 hydroxylase deficiency can also occur. The mineralocorticoid manifestations in C-11 \ndeficiency can be ‘biphasic. ’ In early infancy, despite having excessive mineralocorticoid hormones, \npatients sometimes present with relative ‘salt wasting’ (aldosterone deficiency). This is because \nsome infants have inefficient salt conservation as well as immature aldosterone production. \nDuring this phase, infants can present with hypotension and hyperkalemia (very similar to 21 \nhydroxylase deficiency). Later in life (childhood and adulthood), there is better ability to hold onto \nsalt, so the patient develops the typical C-11 deficiency syndrome: hypertension and hypokalemia.Note\nThe ‘biphasic’ presentation is \nrare. When you think about \n11 deficiency, think \nmineralocorticoid excess \n(hypertension and \nhypokalemia) with low cortisol \nproduction (remember you \nneed C-11 for the final step in \nconverting to cortisol).\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   53 16/05/19   10:33 AM",
    "page_61": "54\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nC-17 hydroxylase deficiency  can occur as well, and is characterized by hypogonadism, hypoka -\nlemia, and hypertension resulting from increased production of 11-deoxycorticosterone.\nDiagnosis.  CAH should be considered in all infants exhibiting failure to thrive, especially \nthose with episodes of acute adrenal insufficiency, salt wasting, or hypertension. The most \nuseful measurements are of serum testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, \n17-hydroxyprogesterone, urinary 17-ketosteroid, and pregnanetriol.\nManagement.  Treatment is glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone) replacement.\nClinical Recall\nAn elderly, obese, diabetic patient comes to the clinic with LDL levels of \n150 mg/dL.

Gabapentin\nAnswer: B \nHypofunctioning of the Gland\nAdrenal insufficiency\nAdrenal insufficiency can be divided into primary adrenocortical insufficiency  (Addison \n disease ) and secondary failure in the elaboration of ACTH . \nPrimary adrenocortical insufficiency is a slow, usually progressive disease due to adrenocorti-\ncoid hypofunction. The etiology can be secondary to anatomic destruction of the gland \n(chronic and acute). Idiopathic atrophy is the most common cause of anatomic  destruction, \nand autoimmune mechanisms are probably responsible. Autoimmune destruction accounts for \n80% of cases. Anatomic destruction can also be secondary to surgical  removal, infection (TB, \nfungal, cytomegalovirus), hemorrhagic, trauma, and metastatic invasion. Metabolic failure in \nhormone production can also lead to Addison disease and can be secondary to CAH, enzyme \ninhibitors, and cytotoxic agents (mitotane).\nClinical Findings.  The clinical findings in Addison disease include weakness, paresthesias, \ncramping, intolerance to stress, and personality changes such as irritability and restlessness. \nChronic disease is characterized by a small heart, weight loss, and sparse axillary hair. Hyper -\npigmentation of the skin can occur and appears as diffuse brown, tan, or bronze darkening of \nboth exposed and unexposed body parts. Arterial hypotension is seen and is often orthostatic \nowing to lack of effect of cortisol on vascular tone. Abnormalities of GI function are found, \nand symptoms vary from mild anorexia with weight loss to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and \nabdominal pain. Acute Addisonian crisis is characterized by fever and hypotension. A low \nsodium with a high potassium level and mild acidosis are also present.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   54 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

The rule of 10%  applies in pheochromocytoma with 10% \nbeing extraadrenal, 10% malignant, 10% in children, and 10% bilateral or multiple (>right \nside). Also, 10% are not associated with hypertension.\nEpidemiology.  Pheochromocytoma occurs in approximately 0.1% of the hypertensive \npopulation. Familial pheochromocytoma occurs in 5% of cases, and is transmitted as an \nautosomal dominant trait alone or in combination with MEN type IIa or IIb, von Recklinghau-\nsen neurofibromatosis, or von Hippel-Lindau retinal cerebellar hemangioblastomatosis.\nPathology.  In adults, 80% of pheochromocytomas occur as a unilateral solitary lesion with \n10% being bilateral and 10% extraadrenal. In children, 25% of the tumors are bilateral and 25% \nare extraadrenal. Solitary lesions favor the right side. Extraadrenal pheochromocytomas are \nmostly located within the abdomen and near the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior \nmesenteric ganglia.\nCatecholamine Secretion . Secretion of dopamine occurs more in familial syndromes and is \nnot associated with hypertension. Epinephrine secretion causes tachycardia, sweating, flush-\ning, and hypertension. Norepinephrine is secreted by all extraadrenal tumors.\nClinical Findings.  Clinical findings of pheochromocytoma include paroxysms or crisis. This \naccounts for the typical manifestations occurring in >50% of patients. The attack has a sudden \nonset, lasting from a few minutes to several hours or longer. Headache, profuse sweating, \npalpitations, and apprehension are common in this setting. Pain in the chest or abdomen may \nbe associated with nausea and vomiting. Blood pressure is elevated with tachycardia in crisis. \nForty percent of patients have blood pressure elevation only during the attack, and 60% have \nstable hypertension. Anxiety, tremor, and weight loss are also found.\n>33% of pheochromocytomas cause death prior to diagnosis; death is often due to cardiac \narrhythmia and stroke.\nOther clinical features include orthostatic hypotension and glucose intolerance. The hypergly-\ncemia is only found in about 33% of patients and is mild.\nDiagnosis.  Diagnosis is established by demonstrating increased amounts of catecholamines or \ncatecholamine metabolites in a 24-hour urine collection. Urinary-free catecholamines, urinary \nmetanephrines, vanillylmandelic acid, and plasma catecholamines are tests of choice. Meta-\nnephrines are catecholamine metabolites. A 24-hour urinary VMA, metanephrines, and free \ncatecholamines are the best initial tests. Recently, plasma metanephrine levels have been used \nin conjunction with urinary tests. Overall, metanephrines are the most sensitive and specific \nindividual test. Smoking can increase plasma-free metanephrines. The patient must not smoke \nat least 4 hours before the test.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   56 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

Failure of epinephrine levels to fall after \nclonidine administration is highly suggestive of pheochromocytoma. A clonidine-  suppression \ntest is used when the screening tests are equivocal.\nWhen the catecholamine or metanephrine levels are abnormal, the tumor is confirmed with \nCT or MRI scan. If the biochemical tests (catecholamines, metanephrines) are positive and the \nCT scan does not show the location of the pheochromocytoma, then do an MIBG (metaiodo-\nbenzylguanidine) scan.\nNational Institutes of Health\nFigure 2-17. Pheochromocytoma\nThe differential diagnosis of pheochromocytoma includes essential hypertension, anxiety \nattacks, factitious crisis, intracranial lesions, and autonomic epilepsy.\nManagement.  Alpha-adrenergic blockade, phentolamine and/or phenoxybenzamine, is \nrequired to control BP and prevent a hypertensive crisis, since high circulating catecholamine \nlevels stimulate alpha receptors on blood vessels and cause vasoconstriction.\n• Beta blockers are used if significant tachycardia occurs after  alpha blockade; beta \nblockers are not administered until adequate alpha blockade has been established, since \nunopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can precipitate a hypertensive crisis.\n• Noncardioselective beta blockers (propranolol, nadolol) are the usual choice, though \ncardioselective agents (atenolol, metoprolol) may be used.\n• Labetalol has been associated with paradoxic episodes of hypertension thought to be \nsecondary to incomplete alpha blockade.\nCurative surgical removal of the pheochromocytoma is performed only after BP has been \nstabilized; during surgery, IV phentolamine—a rapid-acting alpha-adrenergic antagonist—is \nused for controlling BP .\nDISEASES OF THE TESTES, HYPOGONADISM\nIn hypogonadism there is decreased function of the testes or ovaries, resulting in the absence \nor impairment of secondary sexual characteristics and infertility.\n02_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch02.indd   57 16/05/19   10:33 AM",

They are typically found in patients whose immune system is predis-\nposed to generating antibodies against their own body tissues (called autoimmunity ), such as \nSLE, Sjögren syndrome, and systemic sclerosis. However, they are also found in ~5% of healthy \npeople (though usually in low titers [<1:80]).\nThe ANA test is performed by exposing the antibodies in the serum of the blood to the \nlaboratory test cells. It is then determined whether there are antibodies that react with various \nparts of the nucleus. Fluorescent techniques are now often used, thus the test may be referred \nto as a fluorescent antinuclear antibody test (FANA).\nANAs present in different patterns depending on the staining of the cell nucleus: homoge-\nneous, speckled, nucleolar, and peripheral (or rim). While these patterns are not specific for \nany one disease, certain diseases can more frequently be associated with one pattern \nor  another. \n• Peripheral (rim) pattern may be seen with SLE\n• Nucleolar pattern is commonly seen with systemic sclerosis\n• Speckled pattern is more commonly seen in healthy people\nSubsets of ANAs are associated with specific autoimmune diseases and thus used to further \ndiagnose those diseases. For example, anti ds-DNA and anti-SM antibodies are found in \npatients with SLE; anti-histone antibodies are found in patients with drug-induced lupus.\n03_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch03.indd   63 16/05/19   10:35 AM",

It is unclear whether the antibodies are directly involved in the etiology \nof the clotting disorder associated with this syndrome. The nature of these antibodies causes \nthe common lab abnormalities associated with the syndrome, i.e., elevated partial thrombo-\nplastin time (PTT) and false-positive RPR or VDRL. \nClinically, it presents with spontaneous abortions in otherwise healthy women or thromboem-\nbolism (pulmonary embolism, DVT) in other patients. Two first-trimester spontaneous \nabortions suggest antiphospholipid antibodies.\nRHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS\nA 26-year-old woman with no prior medical history presents with a 3-week history \nof joint swelling and stiffness. She informs you that she has had stiffness for about \n2 h every morning since the symptoms started and that the symptoms improve as \nthe day progresses. She denies back stiffness or back pain. She has fatigue and \nlow-grade fever. On examination of the wrist, MCPs and PIPs are red and swollen \non both hands. The DIPs are not involved. There is fluid in the wrist joints. \nOtherwise the examination is normal.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory multisystemic disease with the main \ntarget being the synovium. The hallmark of RA is inflammatory synovitis which presents in a \nsymmetric distribution. The intense joint inflammation that occurs has the potential to destroy \ncartilage and cause bone erosions and eventually deform the joint.\nAnti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) is also positive in RA and carries a very high specificity.\nThe cause of RA is unknown.\n• May be triggered as a reaction to an infectious agent (mycoplasma, parvovirus) in a \nsusceptible host\n• Of the environmental factors, only cigarette smoking seems to be associated with RA\n• Women affected 3× more than men\n• Age of onset usually age 35–50 (80%)\nAn initiation phase of nonspecific inflammation occurs, followed by an amplification phase \nresulting from T-cell activation, and finally the stage of chronic inflammation and tissue injury.\nThe predominant infiltrating cell is the T lymphocyte . Diseases such as HIV , where T cells are \ndecreased, will characteristically improve preexisting RA; this also explains why RA is very \nrare in patients with HIV .\nRecent studies have shown that excessive amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokines—  tumor \nnecrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 (IL-6)—mediate most of the \npathogenic features of RA.

The diagnosis is based on the use of clinical criteria; there is no single test or \nfinding that will diagnose RA. Anti-CCP is more specific than RF.\nTreatment.  None of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to \nbe better than aspirin in RA, but they have fewer GI side effects.\nThere is no single NSAID superior to other agents, and the newer agents have not been shown \nto have a decreased incidence in toxicity (GI, renal, etc.).\nCyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors are a type of NSAID which selectively blocks the COX-2 \nenzyme at the site of inflammation. The benefit of COX-2 inhibitors is that they do not inhibit \nCOX-1, an enzyme that helps with the production of the protective stomach  lining. The \nnonselective (traditional) types of NSAIDs block both COX-2 and COX-1, which can lead to \nincreased risk for GI side effects (bleeding, etc.).Note\nIn 2010, new criteria for RA \nwere proposed by the \nAmerican College of \nRheumatology and European \nLeague against Rheumatism \nfocusing more on serologies,  \nacute phase reactants, \nnumber of joints involved,  \nand duration of joint \ninvolvement over 6 weeks . \nThis leads to a point system.\nFor the moment, the 1987 \ncriteria are not obsolete.\n03_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch03.indd   66 16/05/19   10:35 AM",

TNF inhibitors  relieve \nthe signs and symptoms of RA, and slow or halt radiographic damage. These drugs have been \nshown to be effective in patients who were thought to be resistant to all  methotrexate.\nLatent a ssessment and treatment for TB are required before use of any of these agents.\nThere are 3 TNF inhibitors approved for the treatment of RA:\n• Infliximab (Remicade) is a monoclonal antibody to TNF-α that binds to TNF-α in the \njoint and in the circulation. The combination of infliximab and methotrexate is very \neffective in reducing clinical manifestations of disease. Infliximab is given as an IV \ninfusion. Cases of sepsis, disseminated tuberculosis, and other opportunistic infec -\ntions have been reported for patients treated with infliximab or other anti-TNF \ntherapy.\n• Adalimumab (Humira) is an anti-TNF mAb that differs from infliximab in that its \nsequences are entirely human.\n• Etanercept (Enbrel) is a human fusion protein that is entirely human, and anti-etaner -\ncept antibodies are relatively uncommon.\nComplications/ Follow-Up.  Aggressive disease is likely to occur with the following features: \nhigh titers of RF, diffuse rheumatoid nodules, early joint erosions, late age of onset, and certain \nsubtypes of the HLA-DR4.Note\nScreen for TB before using \nTNF inhibitors.\nClinical Pearl\nConsider atlantoaxial \nsubluxation in patients with RA \nwho complain of occipital \nheadaches and upper \nextremity tingling and \nnumbness.\nAlways rule out subclinical \nsubluxation in patients with RA \nwho are undergoing surgery \nand intubation electively.\n03_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch03.indd   67 16/05/19   10:35 AM",

The discoid lupus (DLE) is a circular rash with a raised rim that \noccurs over the scalp and face; it can be disfiguring because of central atrophy and \nscarring. Only 5% of patients with DLE will go on to develop SLE.\n• All patients with renal involvement must undergo renal biopsy before treatment is \ninitiated.\n• Change of personality and psychosis may be manifestations of CNS lupus.

People with severe involvement of the CNS, kidney, heart, and \nlungs have a worse prognosis in terms of overall survival and disability. Lupus nephritis is \nprobably the most common cause of disability in patients with SLE.\nNote the following with respect to  SLE and pregnancy:\n• Fertility rates are normal in patients with SLE, but spontaneous abortion and stillbirth \nare more common when compared with healthy patients; one reason for the spontane -\nous abortion may be anti-phospholipid antibodies, which cause placental infarcts. \nThis is treated with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) during pregnancy.\n• It is unclear whether lupus worsens with pregnancy. In the case of a lupus flare during \npregnancy, steroids may be used safely to suppress the disease.\n• All pregnant patients with lupus need to be screened for SSA/anti-Ro antibodies. \nThese antibodies cross the placenta and are passively transferred to the fetus, causing \nneonatal lupus and heart block.\nDRUG-INDUCED LUPUS\nDrug-induced lupus erythematosus is a side effect of certain medications. Over 40 drugs have \nbeen implicated to cause drug-induced lupus, but the most common are hydralazine, isonia-\nzid, procainamide, and quinidine. Symptoms typically include arthritis, fatigue, fever, and \npleurisy (rare). \nAcute onset SLE is usually not confused with drug-induced lupus, due to the lack of skin \ndisease, kidney disease, and milder symptoms seen in the latter. Also, photosensitivity, hair \nloss, and CNS disease are uncommon in drug-induced lupus.\nPatients with drug-induced lupus develop ANAs, although those with drug-induced lupus \nrelated to quinidine often are ANA-negative. The ANAs in drug-induced lupus are autoanti-\nbodies that react with a histone-DNA complex, which is the major component of the  nucleus \n(anti-histone antibodies).\nAnti-histone antibody testing is a sensitive marker for the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus. \nHydralazine is the exception, as only 35% of patients will have positive anti-histone antibodies.\nOnce the suspected medication is stopped, symptoms resolve in 1–2 weeks.

Anti-TNF drugs \nwork better for axial disease.\nReactive Arthritis\nReactive arthritis (ReA) is a seronegative arthropathy that occurs as a complication from an \ninfection somewhere in the body. There are 2 types of infections causing different  syndromes.\n• One (Reiter syndrome) occurs after a nongonococcal urethritis (chlamydia, urea -\nplasma). These patients have distinct mucocutaneous manifestations: keratoderma \nblennorrhagica, circinate balanitis, oral or genital ulcers, conjunctivitis, and arthritis.\n• The other ReA occurs after an infectious diarrhea caused by Campylobacter , Shigella , \nor Salmonella  organisms (think of the organisms that cause enteroinvasive diarrheas; \nthese are the same ones that cause ReA). The most common is Campylobacter .\nDiagnosis is based on clinical criteria. X-ray findings will be consistent with a seronegative \nspondyloarthropathy.\nTreatment. Treatment is the same as for AS. There are studies that support an accelerated \nrecovery of Reiter syndrome caused by a chlamydial infection from prolonged tetracycline use \n(~3 weeks’ duration). There are also studies to support the notion that prompt antibiotic use in \nurethritis will decrease the chance of Reiter syndrome (this is the only exception to the rule \nthat the seronegative arthropathies are untreatable diseases).\nA severe form of Reiter syndrome and reactive arthritis has been described in HIV patients. \nThe skin manifestations are particularly aggressive in these patients and improve with antiret-\nroviral medications.\n03_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch03.indd   75 16/05/19   10:35 AM",

He tells you that he has had right knee \npain for many years but it has recently gotten worse. He denies constitutional \nsymptoms and other joint pain except for his left second and third DIPs. He has not \nnoticed stiffness in the morning. On examination crepitations are heard as you \nmove the right knee, but otherwise there is no evidence of swelling, warmth, or \nerythema of the knee. Laboratory testing is unremarkable.\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease in humans; the target tissue is articular \ncartilage. There is destruction of cartilage along with secondary remodeling and hypertrophy \nof the bone. Unlike RA, OA is not an inflammatory disease.\n• Knee OA is the leading cause of chronic disability in the elderly.\n• Major risk factors for OA include age, female sex, genetic factors, major joint trauma, \nrepetitive stress, and obesity.\n• Classification:  idiopathic (most common form) where no predisposing factor is evident, \nand secondary , where there is an underlying cause, e.g., another arthropathies (gout), \nendocrine disease (DM, acromegaly), deposition diseases (hemochromatosis), and \nmechanical factors (valgus or varus deformity, unequal lower extremity length). \n –Any disease that causes stress or trauma to a joint may eventually cause secondary OA.\n –Idiopathic OA and secondary OA are pathologically indistinguishable.\nThe most common joint affected by OA is the knee, and the second most common is the base \nof the thumb.\nClinical Presentation. The major joints involved in OA are the weight-bearing joints (hip and \nknee) and the small joints of the fingers (PIPs and DIPs). These joints are affected in an oligoartic -\nular-asymmetric or monoarticular pattern. The joint involvement is very slow, progressive, and \nirreversible. Because the cartilage fails and there is increased pressure on articular bone, joint pain \nincreases with exercise and is relieved by rest. Morning stiffness is always <20–30 min. Crepitations \nmay be noted with movement of the joint. There are no systemic manifestations in OA.\n• Lab tests are always normal, especially indices of inflammation. \n• Thus, ESR and C-reactive protein are always normal. (If ESR is elevated, some other \nprocess is complicating OA, e.g., septic joint, or it is not OA.) \n• X-ray findings include osteophytes and unequal joint space. \n• Osteophytes (spurs) are the reparative efforts by the bone; when these occur in the \nPIPs they are called Bouchard’s nodes, whereas similar changes occurring in the DIPs \nare called Heberden’s nodes.\nDiagnosis is made with clinical and x-ray findings.\nTreatment. There is no cure for OA, so focus on maintaining mobility and reducing pain. Therapy \nis palliative because no agent has been shown to change the natural course of the disease. \n• Reduce joint loading with correction of poor posture and weight loss.\n• Design physical therapy and exercise programs which maintain range of motion, \nstrengthen periarticular muscles, and improve physical fitness.\n03_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch03.indd   77 16/05/19   10:35 AM",

However, it is reasonable \nto add analgesic doses of NSAIDs if there is no relief. Use cautious dosing with the \nelderly because they are at highest risk for the side effects associated with NSAIDs, \nespecially GI (ulcers, hemorrhage, etc.). Consider COX-2 inhibitors for those at high \nrisk for GI complications (only available agent is celecoxib). \n• Use capsaicin cream, which depletes local sensory nerve endings of substance P. Some \npatients do feel local burning.\n• Perform orthopedic surgery and joint arthroplasty only when aggressive medical \ntreatment has been unsatisfactory, especially if the patient’s quality of life has been \ndecreased.\n• Intraarticular injection of hyaluronic acid has been approved for treatment of knee OA \nthat hasn’t responded to pharmacologic treatment. However, its effectiveness has been \nquestioned since a large clinical trial failed to demonstrate superiority over intraarticu -\nlar injections of saline. Similarly, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are not routinely \nused for OA since they have not been shown to be more effective than placebo.

In spite of differences in crystal morphology, they have identical \nclinical presentations and can be distinguished only by synovial fluid analysis.\nGout\nGout is a type of inflammatory arthritis which develops as a result of high levels of uric acid in \nthe blood. It affects mostly middle-aged men (85%), but women become increasingly suscep-\ntible to gout after menopause.Note\nThere are rare cases of erosive \nOA, polyarticular OA, and OA \nwith inflammatory features. \nYou will not need to know \nthem for the exam.\n03_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch03.indd   78 16/05/19   10:35 AM",
    "page_86": "Chapter 3   ●  Rheumatology\n79\nGout presents most commonly with acute monoarthritis. As gout becomes chronic, multiple \njoints may be involved, and deposition of urate crystals in connective tissue (tophi) and kid -\nneys may occur.\n• Metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe is commonly affected (podagra), but other \njoints such as the knee, ankle, PIPs, or DIPs may be initially involved\n• First episode often occurs at night with severe joint pain waking the patient from \nsleep; the joint rapidly becomes warm, red, and tender (it looks exactly like cellulitis)\n• Without treatment the joint pain goes away spontaneously within 3–14 days\nCertain events can precipitate gout: excessive alcohol ingestion, red meat intake, trauma, surgery, \ninfection, steroid withdrawal, drugs (diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide; \nanti-TB medications such as pyrazinamide and ethambutol), or serious medical illness.\nMSU deposition causes an intense inflammatory process—red, warm joint. \nDiagnosis. Serum uric acid level is of no value in the diagnosis of acute urate arthropathy. \nDuring an acute attack, serum uric acid may be normal or low, but many people with elevated \nserum uric acid never develop gout. Diagnosis is made by analysis of synovial fluid instead. On \nsynovial fluid analysis, the MSU crystals are negative birefringent and needle-shaped. WBCs \nwill range 5000–50,000. X-ray of a joint that has been involved in multiple gouty attacks will \nshow erosive calcifications.\nTreatment . With acute gouty arthritis , the goal is to decrease inflammation and thus prevent \nerosion and joint destruction; also in this stage it is very important to avoid fluctuations in \nserum uric acid level.\n• NSAIDs\n• Steroids oral (rarely intraarticular) in elderly patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs/\ncolchicine or in patients with renal impairment\n• Colchicine is rarely to be used in acute gout but is still available.\nWith chronic hyperuricemic gout , the goal is to decrease uric acid levels. This is usually \nrequired for life and initiated in those whose recurrent gouty attacks cannot be corrected by \nlow-purine diet, alcohol limitation, avoiding diuretics, etc. Unlike acute gout, the uric acid \nlevel here may help the physician to follow the effect of hypouricemic treatment.\n• Allopurinol can be used in overproducers, undersecretors, or patients with renal \nfailure or kidney stones\n• Febuxostat is used in those intolerant of allopurinol.\n• Pegloticase dissolves uric acid: used in refractory disease\n• Probenecid can be used in the undersecretors (>80% of adults) only.

She has low-grade fever. Examination reveals \ndecreased passive and active range of motion of the right shoulder joint, as well as \nerythema. She asks you if this is related to an RA flare and if she should start \nsteroids to decrease the pain.\nThe first step would be to do an arthrocentesis .\nThe most common cause of infectious arthritis is gonorrhea, and gonococcal arthritis  accounts \nfor 70% of episodes in patients age <40. Women are at greater risk during menses and preg-\nnancy, and women 2–3x more likely than men to develop disseminated arthritis.\nIn older patients, Staphylococcus aureus  is a common cause of infectious arthritis and  occurs in \npatients with preexisting joint destruction from other rheumatic diseases. Patients with RA \nhave the highest risk because of chronic inflamed or destroyed joints, steroid therapy, and \nfrequent skin breakdown over deformed joints.\nAcute bacterial infection may cause rapid cartilage destruction, and thus a patient presenting \nwith monoarticular arthritis needs prompt diagnosis. This is done by arthrocentesis. Further, \nStaph  or Strep  must be cleaned out of the joint space by arthrocentesis or  arthroscopy.\nRemember that most infected joints with gonococcal will not have positive cultures, and the \nGram stain will be negative.\nTreatment. Treatment should focus on the likely etiology. A 30-year-old woman with acute \nmonoarticular arthritis who has >50,000 WBCs in the synovial fluid without crystals should \nbe treated with ceftriaxone. A 72-year-old man with RA with the same findings should be \ntreated with nafcillin or vancomycin.\nThis disease is discussed further in the Infectious Diseases chapter.\nVASCULITIS SYNDROMES\nVasculitis is an inflammatory process involving the blood vessels, resulting in a decrease of the \nlumen diameter and eventual ischemia of the tissues supplied. The vasculitis syndromes are \nstratified according to the types of vessels involved.\nWegener Granulomatosis\nWegener granulomatosis is a small vessel vasculitis. It typically affects the respiratory tract \n(sinuses, nose, trachea, and lungs) and kidneys, but can involve any organ system.\nThe most common sign of Wegener granulomatosis is involvement of the upper respiratory tract, \nwhich occurs in nearly all patients. Symptoms include rhinitis, sinusitis, and, rarely, nasal ulcers. \n• A common sign of the disease is chronic rhinitis that does not respond to usual \ntreatment and that becomes increasingly worse.\n• Despite lack of symptoms, lungs are affected in most people; if symptoms are present, \nthey include cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. \n03_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch03.indd   81 16/05/19   10:35 AM",

The disease can \naffect nearly any site in the body, except the lungs. It has a predisposition for organs such as \nthe skin, kidney, nerves, and GI tract. \n• Peripheral neuropathies are very common: tingling, numbness, and/or pain in the \nhands, arms, feet, and legs, and mononeuritis (e.g., foot drop). \n• GI manifestations are common: abdominal pain and GI bleed (occasionally mistaken \nfor inflammatory bowel disease). \n• Active hepatitis B infection is seen in a minority of patients.\nDiagnosis is made by biopsy of involved organs (most commonly taken from skin, symptom-\natic nerves, or muscle). The biopsy will show pathologic changes in medium-size  arteries. \nAngiogram of the abdominal vessels may also be helpful for diagnosing PAN, since aneurysms \naffecting the arteries of the kidneys and/or GI tract are found.\nTreatment is high doses of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs (cyclophosphamide). \n(Before these treatments were available, untreated PAN was usually fatal within weeks to \nmonths, with most deaths occurring from kidney failure, or heart or GI  complications.) \nChurg-Strauss Syndrome\nChur g-Strauss syndrome shares many of the clinical and pathologic features of PAN; both \ninvolve the small- and medium-sized arteries. Any organ can be involved.\nThe cardinal manifestations of Churg-Strauss are asthma, eosinophilia, and lung involvement. \nThe typical patient is middle-aged, with new-onset asthma. Asthma symptoms may begin long \nbefore the onset of vasculitis. Other symptoms include mononeuropathy (mononeuritis \nmultiplex similar to PAN), transient pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, paranasal sinus \nabnormalities, nasal polyps, and allergic rhinitis.\nDiagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is similar to PAN (combination of prednisone and \ncytotoxic agent).Clinical Pearl\nIn patients with PAN, exclude \nco-existing chronic active viral \nhepatitis.\nNote\nTo help remember Churg-\nStrauss syndrome, think of it \nas PAN in an asthmatic patient.\n03_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch03.indd   82 16/05/19   10:35 AM",

Physical examination is unremarkable. What is the next step in evaluation?\nAchalasia is caused by degeneration of the myenteric plexus with loss of the normal inhibitory \nneural structure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). There is failure of the LES to relax \nand decreased peristalsis. The LES is usually contracted to prevent the acidic gastric contents \nfrom refluxing backward into the esophagus. \nThe vast majority of cases are of unknown etiology. A very small number can be from  Chagas \ndisease, gastric carcinoma, or a disease that can infiltrate into the area such as  lymphoma.\nClinical Presentation.  Achalasia presents with progressive dysphagia to both solids and \nliquids simultaneously and can have regurgitation several hours after eating. The patient \ncomplains of esophageal dysphagia with possible weight loss. Achalasia has no relationship \nwith alcohol or tobacco use. This is different from esophageal cancer, which not only usually \npresents with dysphagia to solid foods and progresses to difficulty swallowing liquids, but also \nis more common in older patients with a long history of alcohol and tobacco use. \nDiagnosis.  Heme-positive stools, >6-month duration of symptoms, and weight loss will \nconfirm diagnosis. Barium esophagography is very accurate and shows dilation of the esopha-\ngus, which narrows into a “bird’s beak” at the distal end. The most accurate test overall (gold \nstandard) is esophageal manometry, which shows increased lower esophageal (LES) resting \npressure and absence of peristalsis.\nDiagnostic evaluation should be done in the following order:\n1.

Weight loss is prominent. Rarely, halitosis, regurgitation, and hoarseness \noccur. Hypercalcemia may arise, as it can with most cancers.\nTo diagnose, do barium swallow first, but endoscopy is mandatory because this is a diagnosis \nthat requires a tissue biopsy.

The pain can be precipitated by drinking cold \nliquids.\nBarium study may show a “corkscrew”’ pattern at the time of the spasm. The most accurate test \nfor diagnosis is a manometric study, which will show high-intensity, disorganized contractions. \nBecause the contractions are disorganized, they do not lead to the forward flow of food and \nperistalsis.\nTreatment is a calcium-channel blocker e.g., nifedipine, or a nitrate.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   88 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

Neither is progressive in nature, distinguishing them from \nachalasia.\nSchatzki’s ring (more common) leads to intermittent dysphagia and is not associated with pain. \nIt is more distal and located at the squamocolumnar junction proximal to the lower esophageal \nsphincter.\nPVS is more proximal and is located in the hypopharynx. It is typically seen in middle-aged \nwomen. PVS is associated with iron-deficiency anemia and squamous cell cancer.\nBoth disorders are diagnosed with a barium swallow or barium esophagogram.\nTreatment.  PVS may respond to treatment for the iron deficiency. Both are treated with \ndilation procedures.\nEsophagitis\nEsophagitis refers either to infection or inflammation of the esophagus. The most common \ninfection is from Candida albicans . When Candida  esophagitis occurs, it is almost exclusively \nin patients who are HIV-positive with CD4 count <200/mm3 (often even <100/mm3). The \nsecond most common risk for developing Candida  esophagitis is diabetes mellitus. Much rarer \ninfectious etiologies are herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and aphthous ulcers. \nBarium swallow is the incorrect step for esophagitis. It is always the correct first step for dysphagia.\nClinical Presentation.  Candida  esophagitis presents with progressive odynophagia. Although \nthe swallowing is painful, food is still able to pass (until the disease is extremely advanced). \n• Note that the pain in esophagitis is only on swallowing , while the pain in spastic \ndisorders is intermittent without even needing to swallow . \n• Esophagitis pain is simply from the mechanical rubbing of food against an inflamed \nesophagus as it passes by.\nTreatment.  If the patient is HIV-positive, assume  Candida  esophagitis and start fluconazole; \nimproved symptoms will confirm the diagnosis. If symptoms do not improve, perform \nendoscopy and biopsy to exclude other causes such as HSV and CMV . \nNote that the treatment for Candida must be fluconazole . Nystatin swish and swallow will \nnot work (and is a common incorrect answer on the exam). \n• 35% of patients with Candida  esophagitis will not have oral thrush (an absence of oral \ncandida does not rule out esophageal candida)\n• Because esophagitis can also result from ingestion of medication and caustic substances, \nthe direct effect of contact between the mucosa and the pill causes inflammation rather \nthan infection. As with most other toxin-mediated damage to an organ, diagnosis is \nbased on the presentation and identification of the toxin in the history. The most \ncommon pills causing esophagitis are  alendronate, quinine, risedronate, vitamin C, \npotassium chloride, doxycycline, NSAIDs , and  iron sulfate . Consider pill esophagitis in \na young patient who takes acne medication and who has an acute onset of odynophagia. \nPill esophagitis is prevented by simply swallowing pills in the upright position and drinking \nenough water to flush them into the stomach. \n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   89 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

Epigastric pain can be caused by the  following:\n• Pancreatitis (most common reason for epigastric tenderness and pain)\n• Ulcer disease (associated with epigastric tenderness in <20% of patients)\n• GERD\n• Gastritis \n• Gastric cancer (rare)\nHelicobacter pylori  is most strongly associated with the development of duodenal ulcers, gastric \nulcers, and gastritis.\nDespite these diagnostic possibilities, the most common etiology of epigastric pain is, in fact, \nnever truly determined. This is referred to as nonulcer dyspepsia, a functional disorder in \nwhich there is persistent pain in the epigastric area but all tests are found to be normal.\nGuidelines recommend upper endoscopy for patients with dyspepsia and alarm features, so \nthe first step is to look for those. Alarm features include the following:\n• Onset age >50 \n• Anemia\n• Dysphagia\n• Odynophagia\n• Vomiting\n• Weight loss\n• Family history of upper GI malignancy\n• Personal history of peptic ulcer disease\n• Gastric surgery\n• GI malignancy\n• Abdominal mass or lymphadenopathy  on examination\nAny alarm feature requires upper endoscopy . Endoscopy is also indicated if symptoms have \nnot resolved with antisecretory therapy, such as PPIs.\nFor patients age <50 without alarm features, use a test-and-treat approach for H. pylori,  \nnot endoscopy.\nTreatment. Although endoscopy is the most accurate way to diagnose an ulcer, one can \nempirically treat ulcers, reflux disease, and gastritis. \n• Treat young, generally healthy patients empirically with H2 blocker, liquid antacid, or \nPPI; if no improvement, undergo endoscopy.\n• Start by testing for H. pylori .

He says that he sometimes gets this pain while lying in bed at \nnight. He is otherwise free of symptoms, except for a nonproductive cough that he \nhas had for the past month or so. Physical examination is unremarkable. ECG is \nnormal. He is given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes that his chest discomfort is \nworsened.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is caused by the abnormal flow of the acid gastric \ncontents backward from the stomach up into the esophagus. The lower esophageal sphincter \n(LES) is not a true anatomic sphincter (it cannot be found in a cadaver); it is created by the \ndifferent response of the smooth muscle cells in the distal esophagus.\nA number of factors can cause decreased tone or loosening of this sphincter.\n• Nicotine, alcohol, caffeine\n• Peppermint, chocolate\n• Anticholinergics\n• Calcium-channel blockers\n• Nitrates\nWhen the tone of the LES decreases, acid is more likely to reflux backward into the esophagus, \nparticularly when the patient is lying flat. GERD can still occur in the absence of these \nprecipitating factors and can often simply be idiopathic in origin.\nClinical Presentation. GERD will present with heartburn (burning substernal pain); sore \nthroat; a metal-like taste in the mouth; hoarseness; cough and wheezing. In addition, it is often \nassociated with pain in the substernal area. Symptoms are worse after a meal or while lying flat. \nThe most accurate diagnostic test is a 24-hour pH monitor; an electrode is placed several \ncentimeters above the gastroesophageal junction, and a determination is made of what the \naverage pH is in that area. Normal endoscopy does not exclude reflux disease. \nNote the following order when working up GERD:\n• Initiate PPI; if no improvement, increase PPI to 2x daily (before EGD) for 4–8 weeks \nand make sure patient is taking properly (30–60 min before meals)\n• If no improvement, do EGD: If EGD shows esophagitis, that confirms GERD and \n24-hour pH monitoring is not needed. If EGD is normal, do ambulatory 24-hour pH \nmonitoring (while off the PPI) and if results are consistent with GERD, do Nissen \nfundoplication.\nIn clear cases of epigastric pain going under the sternum and associated with a respiratory \ncomplaint or bad taste in the mouth, initiate therapy immediately  with antisecretory medica-\ntions such as PPIs.Note\nThere is no point in treating  \nH. pylori  without evidence of \ndisease such as gastritis or \nulcer disease.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   93 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

Treatment is a PPI and lifestyle modification (avoid nicotine/alcohol/caffeine/\nchocolate/late-night meals and elevate the head of the bed 6–8 inches with blocks to keep acid \nin the stomach)\n• Omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole are all equally \neffective PPIs; they will increase the pH of the gastric contents to a level >4.0. \n• PPI side effects include increased risk for C. difficile  infection, aspiration pneumonia, \nosteoporosis, and hip fracture.\n• A few people (<5%) will not respond to PPIs or will have refractory side effects \n(headaches, diarrhea); those patients will require surgery to tighten the sphincter \n(traditionally, a Nissen fundoplication is done laparoscopically). \n –Do motility studies prior to surgery to avoid iatrogenic dysphagia.\n• Use H2 blockers only if the patient has very mild, intermittent symptoms, as they are \nless effective than PPIs.\nBarrett E sophagus\nBarrett esophagus is a complication of long-standing reflux disease. After several years of \nGERD, the epithelium of the lower esophagus undergoes histologic change from a normal \nsquamous epithelium to a columnar epithelium.\nMen age ≥50 with chronic GERD (5+ years) and additional risk factors (nocturnal symptoms, \nhiatal hernia, obese, smokers) should be screened.\nPatients with Barrett esophagus should have repeat endoscopy every 3–5 years  to see wheth -\ner dysplasia or esophageal cancer has developed:\n• If low-grade dysplasia, repeat endoscopy in 6–12 months\n• If high-grade dysplasia, do radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, or \nendoscopic mucosal resection\n• The usual rate of progression to cancer is about 0.5% per year. \nDo not check barium swallow, as it will be normal.\nTreatment.  All patients with Barrett esophagus should receive PPIs.\nPeptic Ulcer Disease\nPeptic ulcer disease includes both duodenal and gastric ulcers. \nTobacco smoking, alcohol, and steroids by themselves do not cause ulcer disease, although \ntobacco and alcohol can delay healing and are associated with the development of gastritis. \n• NSAIDs can cause ulcer formation because they decrease the normal production of \nthe mucous barrier protecting the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa. Prostaglan -\ndins, the major stimulant for mucous production that forms this protective barrier, are \ninhibited by NSAIDs and hence diminish the protective barrier of the stomach lining. \n• Steroid use by itself does not cause peptic ulcer disease and is therefore not a routine \nindication for stress ulcer prophylaxis.Note\nIn patients with chronic cough \n(≥8 weeks), symptoms typical \nof GERD (heartburn, cough \nthat is worse after a large \nmeal), and negative chest \nx-ray, initiate a PPI as the next \nmost appropriate step.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   94 16/05/19   10:39 AM",
    "page_102": "Chapter 4   ●  Gastroenterology\n95\nParietal cells in the stomach produce acid. The 3 stimulants to the production of acid from \nthe parietal cells are gastrin, acetylcholine, and histamine. \n• Gastrin is produced by G cells in the stomach, and its release is stimulated by disten -\ntion of the stomach, the presence of amino acids, and vagal stimulation. Vagal \nstimulation also releases acetylcholine and gastrin-releasing peptide. However, the \nsingle most important stimulant to gastrin release is distention of the stomach.\n• Histamine is released by enterochromaffin-like cells present in the same glandular ele -\nments of the stomach that have the parietal and chief cells. Chief cells release pepsino -\ngen, which is converted to pepsin by the acid environment of the gastric lumen. \nHistamine directly stimulates the parietal cells to both release acid and potentiate the \neffects of acetylcholine and gastrin on the parietal cells. This is why H2 blockers such \nas cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine inhibit acid release. \nZollinger-Ellison syndrome is the excessive production and release of gastrin from the \npancreas. Somatostatin is the counterbalance to this system, inhibiting the release of gastrin \nand histamine, as well as having a direct inhibitory effect on the production of acid from the \nparietal cells. Secretin is released from the S cells of the duodenal lining. The main stimulant to \nthe release of secretin is the presence of acid in the duodenum. Secretin inhibits the produc-\ntion of gastrin, as well as stimulates pancreatic and biliary bicarbonate production and release. \nThe most common cause of ulcer disease is Helicobacter pylori  followed by the use of \nNSAIDs; 80–90% of duodenal ulcers and 70–80% of gastric ulcers are associated with \nH. pylori . Overall, 10–20% of ulcers are idiopathic, and no clear etiology is ever  identified.\nClinical Presentation.  The most common presentation of ulcer disease is midepigastric pain. \nThere is no definite way to distinguish between duodenal and gastric ulcer simply by symp-\ntoms. Gastric ulcer is often associated with pain on eating (frequently leading to weight loss), \nwhile duodenal ulcer is thought to be relieved by eating. However, these  associations are only \nrough approximations, and endoscopy is still required for a definite diagnosis.\nTenderness of the abdomen is unusual with ulcer disease. More than 80% are not associated \nwith abdominal tenderness in the absence of a perforation. Nausea and vomiting are occasion-\nally found with both of them. \nDiagnosis.  Ulcer disease is best diagnosed with upper endoscopy. Barium studies are  inferior. \n• If patient age <50 and has no alarm symptoms, test and treat for H. pylori . If H. pylori \nis negative, give trail of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). If symptoms persist, perform \nendoscopy.\n• If patient age >50 or has alarm symptoms (weight loss, anemia, heme-positive stools, \nor dysphagia), perform endoscopy.\nThe diagnosis of H. pylori  is based on urea breath testing, stool antigen testing, or biopsy with \nhistology or rapid urease testing. The first 2 tests are non-invasive. Before testing for H. pylori , \nmake sure the patient is off PPIs for 2 weeks and antibiotics for 4 weeks , as they can \ncause  false-negatives. Biopsy with histology can be done on treatment. Biopsy with rapid \nurease testing can also be false-negative on treatment.\nDo not check serum antibodies as they will not indicate whether this is a past or present infection. \nTreatment.  The treatment of ulcer disease centers largely on the treatment of H. pylori . Use a \nproton pump inhibitor (PPI) combined with clarithromycin and amoxicillin. The PPIs omepra -\nzole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and esomeprazole are all equal in  efficacy.Note\nGastric ulcers must be \nbiopsied to exclude cancer.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   95 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

Follow-up endoscopy for duodenal ulcers is not required.\nTesting for eradication is indicated only for persistent symptoms, ulcers, or malignancy. \n• Wait 4−8 weeks after treatment to check for eradication. Do not use serology to test \nfor eradication. \n• If the organism was not eradicated, then repeat treatment with different antibiotics, \nplus bismuth subsalicylate. Explore sensitivity testing for the organism. \n• If the organism was eradicated and the ulcer persists or worsens, consider evaluating \nthe patient for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nOrdinary ulcers not related to Helicobacter can be treated with PPIs alone.

There is no \nblood or pus with the stools. She takes maximum doses of omeprazole daily, along \nwith famotidine, and still has ulcer symptoms. She has a mild hypercalcemia.  \nZollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is hypergastrinemia caused by cancer of the gastrin-  producing \ncells. There is no known cause for gastrinoma or ZES. Half of these gastrinomas are located in the \nduodenum, and 25% in the pancreas. A small percentage (<20%) are associated with multiple \nendocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) or parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreatic tumor.\nClinical Presentation.  More than 95% of patients with ZES present with ulcer disease. Fewer \nthan 1% of people with ulcer disease have an underlying ZES or gastrinoma. \nZES presents with ulcers that are recurrent after therapy, multiple in number, occur in the distal \nportion of the duodenum, or are resistant to routine therapy. Diarrhea occurs in 70% of patients, \ni.e., ordinary watery diarrhea or steatorrhea (due to inactivated lipase from large volume of acid \npassed into the duodenum). Metastatic disease is evident at the time of diagnosis in 30% of \npatients; an additional 20% develop metastatic disease later.\nDiagnosis. Although an elevated gastrin level is indicative of ZES, remember that all  patients \non H2 blockers or PPIs have elevated gastrin. That is because the main stimulus to the suppres-\nsion of gastrin release is acid. If acid production is suppressed, then gastrin goes up. So to \ndiagnose ZES, gastrin must be found elevated after the patient has been off antisecretory \ntherapy for several days. Note\nThe presence of hypercalcemia \nis the clue to detecting MEN-1. \nThis is because of the \nhyperparathyroidism.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   97 16/05/19   10:39 AM",
    "page_105": "98\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nDiagnosis is the combination of elevated gastrin and increased gastric acidity (must check \ngastric pH to make diagnosis; if pH >4, it is not a gastrinoma). The secretin stimulation test is \npositive (abnormal) if there is a rise in gastrin level after the injection of secretin (normally, \nsecretin should suppress gastrin release).\nOther causes of increased gastrin include:\n• Pernicious anemia\n• Chronic gastritis\n• Renal failure\n• Hyperthyroidism\nAfter confirming a diagnosis of gastrinoma, the most important step is to determine if the \nlesion is localized or metastatic. \n• Localized lesions can be surgically removed. \n• Metastatic disease can be suppressed only with PPIs \n –U/S, CT, and MRI have 60–80% sensitivity for the presence of metastatic disease—\nspecific enough to prove the presence of tumor if positive but not sensitive enough \nto safely exclude disease if negative\n• A nuclear test, somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy, is 90% sensitive for the detection of \nmetastatic disease. The single most sensitive test is the endoscopic U/S. Typically, both \ntests are done.\nTreatment.  Localized disease is surgically resected and metastatic disease is treated with the \nlong-term administration of PPIs simply to block acid production.\nGastroparesis\nGastroparesis, or delayed gastric emptying, results in delayed movement of food from the stomach \nto the small intestine. The most common association is diabetes. Electrolyte problems with \npotassium, magnesium, and calcium can also weaken the musculature of the bowel wall.\nClinical Presentation.  Patients with gastroparesis present with early satiety, postprandial \nnausea, and a general sense of increased abdominal fullness due to decreased motility of the \nstomach and the accumulation of food there. Gastroparesis generally occurs in those  presenting \nwith abdominal pain and bloating,  and those with a long-standing history of diabetes, a \nlong-standing history of poor glycemic control, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. It \ncan accompany scleroderma, hypothyroidism, anti-cholinergic use, and narcotic use. \nDiagnosis.  The first test should be endoscopy. Although gastroparesis is often diagnosed \nclinically, the gastric-emptying study is the confirmatory test; radioisotope-labeled food is \ningested to measure transit time through the stomach. In a long-term diabetic, a diagnosis of \ndiabetic gastroparesis is generally obvious as the cause of bloating, vomiting, and nausea, after \nendoscopy excludes other diseases.  Make sure blood glucose <275 mg/dL before testing  \nbecause severe hyperglycemia can impair gastric emptying. \nTreatment.  Treatment is agents that will increase motility of the stomach, such as erythromy-\ncin or metoclopramide. Also, smaller, more frequent portions of food are recommended, since \nemptying from the stomach is faster when there is less food.\nMetoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia, Parkinsonism, and dystonia. \n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   98 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

The most common causes include an infec-\ntious, antibiotic-associated, or lactose-intolerance etiology, irritable bowel syndrome, and \ncarcinoid syndrome.\nThe patient is often hypotensive, febrile, and experiencing abdominal pain.\nDiagnosis.  The first step in the evaluation of diarrhea is to see if there is hypovolemia as \ndefined as hypotension or orthostasis. This is more important than determining specific \netiology because the patient could die while waiting for the results to come back.\nTreatment. No matter the etiology, if the patient is hypotensive, febrile, and having  abdominal pain, \nadmit as inpatient and give IV fluids and antibiotics. Blood in the stool is especially serious, and is \nprobably the single strongest indication for the use of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin.\nInfectious Diarrhea\nThe majority of acute diarrhea is viral and self-limited. Clostridium difficile  toxin and stool \nGiardia -antigen testing are done when there are clues to these diagnoses in the history.\nWith bacterial diarrhea, the most common causes are Campylobacter  and Salmonella , espe-\ncially in patients with sickle cell and achlorhydria.

Invasive organisms \nneed 24–36 hours to produce their effect and never produce blood in the stool within the first \nfew hours of ingestion (except the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica , which can give blood or \nwhite cells in stool). The most definitive test for these bacterial organisms is stool culture. \nThe invasive organisms are:\n• Salmonella\n• Shigella\n• Campylobacter\n• Vibrio parahaemolyticus\n• Yersinia\n• E. coli\n• Vibrio vulnificus  (think people drinking sea water) \nCryptosporidiosis diagnosis requires a unique test—a modified acid-fast test; it cannot be \ndetected reliably by the routine ova and parasite exam.\nGiardia  diagnosis is best made with an ELISA stool antigen test (a single test has 90% \n sensitivity, whereas 3 stool ova and parasite exams have only 80% sensitivity). Consider this for \nchronic diarrhea in patients exposed to young children or who drank water from a lake or \nstream. \nTreatment. Most cases of food poisoning and infectious diarrhea will resolve spontaneously \nand will not need antimicrobial therapy. Even when they cause severe disease, as  defined by \nhigh-volume stools with dehydration, antibiotics generally do not help. Use  antibiotics if there \nis abdominal pain, blood in the stool, and fever >7 days. \nThe decision to use antibiotics is always made prior to knowing the result of the stool  culture, \nso the treatment is always empiric and then modified when the culture results are known.

Typically, no pathogens are identified; the diarrhea is caused by changes in the composi -\ntion and function of the intestinal flora, as well as increased motility (common with agents like \nerythromycin). Most patients respond to supportive measures and discontinuation of antibiotics.\nClostridium difficile-associated  diarrhea  (C. diff ) refers to a spectrum of diarrheal illnesses \ncaused by the toxins produced by C. diff , including severe colitis with or without the \npresence of pseudomembranes. (For exam purposes, this discussion will focus on C. diff .)\nPathogenesis. Any antibiotic can lead to diarrhea with C. diff , although antibiotics that are \nbroad spectrum are more likely to do so. Clindamycin may have one of the highest frequencies \nof association, as do fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins.\nC. diff  diarrhea is largely a nosocomial disease and is the most frequent cause of diarrhea in \nhospitalized patients. It occurs infrequently in the outpatient setting, other than in patients \nconfined to nursing homes. Research suggests a significant association between C. difficile  and \nthe use of PPIs.\nClinical Presentation and Diagnosis. The clinical manifestations of C. diff  may vary from \nmild diarrhea to fulminant colitis. If a patient develops diarrhea several days to weeks (even \nup to 8 weeks) after using antibiotics, evaluate for C. diff . Marked leukocytosis and systemic \nsymptoms are evident in severe cases.\n• Until a few years ago, the diagnostic method of choice for C. difficile  colitis was the \nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on toxin detection in the stool. \nWhile ELISA is fast, inexpensive, and has excellent specificity, its sensitivity is variable \n(75−85%). \n• The newer preferred method of diagnosis is the nucleic acid amplification (LAMP, \nloop-mediated isothermal amplification) assay, which may include the real-time \npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification test (both \nof which detect the toxin A and B genes responsible for the production of toxins). \nLAMP has specificity 94−100% and sensitivity 90−100%. There is no benefit to testing \nmultiple stool specimens or repeat testing following a positive test.\nTreatment. Metronidazole is the drug of choice along with discontinuation of antibiotics (if \nfeasible) and supportive therapy. If the diagnosis is highly likely and the patient is seriously ill, \nmetronidazole may be given empirically before the test results. Oral vancomycin is reserved \nfor the following conditions:\n• Failed therapy with metronidazole\n• Organisms resistant to metronidazole\n• Allergy or intolerance to metronidazoleNote\nEffective 2018, metronidazole \nis no longer considered  \nfirst-line treatment for  \nC. difficile . PO vancomycin or \nfidaxomicin  is now \nconsidered first-line treatment.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   105 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

Use IV metronidazole if patient is unable to use oral medication (This is not \ntrue of vancomycin, i.e., IV vancomycin will have no effect in the bowel because it does not \npass bowel wall. Similarly, oral vancomycin will have no systemic effect.)\nIf there is a second recurrence, use a prolonged course of oral vancomycin taper (6–8 weeks). \nIt must be 6 weeks to be effective and it must be tapered. Alternatively, consider fecal trans-\nplant or a new drug, fidaxomicin (note that this is not more effective than vancomycin or \nmetronidazole for the first episode). Fidaxomicin seems to reduce the number of episodes of \nrecurrent C. difficile  colitis.\nLactose Intoleran ce\nLactose intolerance is perhaps the single most common potential cause of diarrhea because of \nthe enormously high prevalence of lactase deficiency. This is a disorder so common that the \ntesting and treatment are generally empiric.\nThe diarrhea produced is associated with gas and bloating, but never contains blood or \nleukocytes. Despite the malabsorption of lactose, weight loss does not occur.\nDiagnosis can be confirmed with increased stool osmolality and increased osmolar gap. \n• Osmolar gap means that the difference between the osmolality measure in the stool \nand the osmolality calculated from the sodium and potassium levels is >50 mOsm/kg. \n• Therefore, the measured stool osmolality is greater than would be expected just by the \nlevel of sodium and potassium. The extra osmoles are from lactose. \n• Other causes of an increased stool osmolar gap are magnesium and polyethylene \nglycol in the stool, or nutrient malabsorption leading to pancreatic insufficiency, celiac \nsprue, and bacterial overgrowth.\nThe routine way to diagnose lactose intolerance is simply to remove milk, cheese, ice cream, \nand other dairy products (except yogurt) from the diet and observe for resolution of \n symptoms, which should occur within 24–36 hours. (This differs from celiac disease, where \nresolution of diarrheal symptoms make take weeks after stopping the ingestion of gluten-  \ncontaining foods.) If resolution of symptoms does occur, then dietary changes are the best \ntherapy. The patient can use lactase supplements.\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\nAlthough it is often described at the same time as diarrheal illnesses, irritable bowel syndrome \n(IBS) is predominantly a pain syndrome of unknown etiology. IBS is an idiopathic disorder in \nwhich there is increased frequency of the normal peristaltic and segmentation contractions of \nthe bowel. Pain is often relieved by a bowel movement.\n• 20% of patients have constipation only, while a large percentage have diarrhea alone or \ndiarrhea alternating with constipation. \n• Everyone has pain. \n• There are no nocturnal symptoms.\n• There are no constitutional signs or symptoms, e.g., fever, weight loss, anorexia, or anemia.Note\nDo not use fidaxomicin for \nthe first episode  of C. diff \ncolitis.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   106 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

They are most often \nlocated in the appendix and ileum. By definition carcinoid syndrome implies metastatic disease \n(except for bronchial carcinoids). Until there is an enormous tumor burden, the liver is able to \nneutralize all of the serotonin released by the carcinoid in the bowel. This usually does not \nhappen until the metabolic capacity of the liver has been overwhelmed by metastatic disease.\nBronchial carcinoids are rare but highly symptomatic because the serotonin produced is \nreleased directly into the circulation without being detoxified in the liver.\nClinical Presentation.  Carcinoid syndrome presents with diarrhea, flushing, tachycardia, and \nhypotension. A rash may develop from niacin deficiency, a direct result of the carcinoid. \nSerotonin and niacin are both produced from tryptophan, so if there is an overproduction of \nserotonin, a tryptophan deficiency and thus a niacin deficiency, will result.  Endocardial fibrosis \nalso occurs because of a constant exposure of the right side of the heart to the serotonin. This \nleads to tricuspid insufficiency and pulmonic stenosis.\nDiagnosis.  The diagnosis is confirmed with urinary 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid level  \n(5-HIAA).\nTreatment. Therapy  is generally based on controlling the diarrhea with octreotide, a soma-\ntostatin analog. Very few carcinoids are sufficiently localized to be amenable to surgical \nresection. If a tumor does happen to be localized, then it should be resected. This is most often \npossible with bronchial carcinoid. Surgery is also used to relieve obstruction of the bowel.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   107 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

What they all have in \ncommon is the production of diarrhea characterized as greasy, oily, floating, and fatty, with a \nparticularly foul smell, as if fat were fermenting. This type of diarrhea with fat is called steatorrhea .\nAll malabsorption syndromes are characterized by weight loss because fat has the highest \ncaloric content of all the foods. In addition, there is malabsorption of the fat-soluble vitamins \nA, D, E, and K.\n• Vitamin A deficiency: night blindness (early), complete blindness\n• Vitamin D deficiency: hypocalcemia hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia\n• Vitamin E deficiency: neuromuscular disorders, hemolysis\n• Vitamin K deficiency: prolongation of prothrombin time and easy bruising \nIron malabsorption  occurs if there is involvement of the duodenum where iron is  normally \nabsorbed. Iron deficiency anemia is evident in all patients with celiac sprue. Macrocytic \nanemia occurs if folate is malabsorbed. Vitamin B12 malabsorption  occurs from damage or \nloss of the mucosal surface of the terminal ileum. \nClinical Presentation.  All malabsorption syndromes present with chronic diarrhea. The only \nunique feature of celiac disease is dermatitis herpetiformis, a vesicular skin rash on the extensor \nsurfaces of the body (10% of patients). Even without dermatitis herpetiformis,  celiac disease is \nthe most likely etiology of fat malabsorption because it is the most common. \nChronic Pancreatitis\nChronic pancreatitis is diagnosed with the following:\n• History of pain, recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, weight loss\n• Pancreatic calcifications on imaging\n• Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (steatorrhea)\n• Diabetes\n• Chronic alcohol abuse (most common cause)\nIf CT does not show calcifications, get MRCP to detect abnormal pancreatic ducts.\nFor young adults with chronic pancreatitis, work up for cystic fibrosis (especially if there is \nrecurrent pneumonia, sinusitis, and infertility).\nSuspect tropical sprue when there is a history of being in a tropical country, and Whipple \ndisease (very rare) if there is dementia  (10%),  arthralgia  (80%), and ophthalmoplegia .\nTreatment . Treatment includes pancreatic enzymes; pain control with NSAID/acetamino-\nphen, tramadol (may cause hypoglycemia), tricyclic antidepressant, gabapentin, or pregabalin; \ninsulin (required for diabetics, as it mimics type 1 diabetes due to destruction of beta cells).

They often \ndevelop where the muscles are weakest, e.g., where penetrating vessels cross through muscle.\nDiverticulosis\nDiverticulosis is so common in older populations throughout the Western world (50% of \npersons age >50, with higher rates in older populations) that it is almost considered a normal \npart of aging. The cause of diverticulosis is believed to a lack of fiber in the diet to give bulk to \nstool.

When symptoms do exist, \nthey are typically left lower quadrant abdominal pain that is colicky in nature.\nDiverticulosis is diagnosed with colonoscopy. Endoscopy is superior to barium study, particu-\nlarly when bleeding is present. Diverticula are more common on the left in the sigmoid, but \nbleeding occurs more often from diverticula on the right because of thinner mucosa and more \nfragile blood vessels. When bleeding occurs from diverticula, it is painless.\nTreatment.  Treatment is an increased-fiber diet, as is found in bran, bulking agents such as \npsyllium husks, and soluble fiber supplements.\nDiverticulitis\nDiverticulitis occurs when one of the bulges or pockets (diverticula) becomes infected. This can \noccur when the diverticular entrance in the colon becomes blocked, perhaps by nuts or corn.\nDiverticulitis is distinguished from uninfected diverticula  by the presence of fever, tender -\nness, more intense pain, and elevated white blood cell count.\nDiagnosis is confirmed with CT scan.

She also has a history of diabetes with peripheral neuropathy, for \nwhich she takes amitriptyline. She has untreated hypothyroidism, but is treated \nfor hypertension with nifedipine. Currently, she has constipation, and when the \nstool does pass, it is very dark in color, almost black.\nThe most common cause of constipation is lack of dietary fiber and insufficient fluid intake. \nCalcium-channel blockers, oral ferrous sulfate, hypothyroidism, opiate analgesics, and medi -\ncations with anticholinergic effects such as the tricyclic antidepressants all cause constipation. \nIn the patient above, the most likely cause of the constipation is the ferrous sulfate.\n• Very dark stool, as in this patient, occurs only with bleeding, bismuth subsalicylate \ningestion, and iron replacement. \n• However, GI bleed produces diarrhea—not constipation—because blood acts as a cathartic. \n• Blood causes diarrhea, and iron tablets cause constipation.\nTreatment.  Stop all medications that cause constipation; then make sure the patient stays \nwell-hydrated and consumes 20–30 grams of daily fiber. \n• Bulking agents, such as those used to manage diverticular diseases\n• Drug treatment: milk of magnesia, cascara, bisacodyl, docusate\n• Enema (acute and serious constipation)\n• Lactulose and polyethylene glycol\nCOLON CANCER\nThe lifetime risk of colon cancer is >6%. Most cases occur sporadically, which is to say there is \nno clearly identified etiology. \nA diet high in red meat and fat leads to an increased risk, as does smoking.\n• When the cancer is in the right side of the colon, patients present with heme-  positive, \nbrown stool and chronic anemia. \n• When the cancer is in the left side or in the sigmoid colon, patients present with \nobstruction and narrowing of stool caliber. \n• That is because the right side of the colon is wider than the left, and the stool is more \nliquid in that part of the bowel, making obstruction less likely on the right. \n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   111 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

Anyone presenting with endocarditis due to one of these \norganisms requires a GI work-up.\nDiagnosis.  Colonoscopy is the most accurate diagnostic test. Sigmoidoscopy will reach the \nlesion only within the distal 60 cm of the colon. If the lesion is in the distal area then the \nsigmoidoscopy will be equally sensitive as colonoscopy, but only 60% of cancers occur there. \nBarium study is not as accurate as colonoscopy, nor can you biopsy.\nTreatment.  Treatment depends on the stage of disease and extent of its spread. \n• Single liver metastatic lesion: surgical resection\n• Cancer localized to the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis layers: surgical resection; \ncurable \n• Cancer penetrated to the serosa and spread into surrounding tissue and lymph nodes: \nsurgical resection not effective in eradicating disease \n• Widespread disease: chemotherapy (mainstay of chemotherapy for GI malignancies \nsuch as colon cancer is 5-fluorouracil [5FU])\nScreening.  The standard screening recommendation for colon cancer is as follows. Screening \nshould occur in the general population after age 50.\n• High-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) every year\n• Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years\n• Combined high-sensitivity FOBT (every 3 years) plus flexible sigmoidoscopy (every  \n5 years) OR colonoscopy every 10 years\nIf adenomatous polyps were found on previous colonoscopy, repeat colonoscopy in 3–5 years. \nIn cases of family history of colon cancer, begin screening at age 40 or 10 years earlier than the \nfamily member got cancer, whichever is younger (also see Preventive Medicine chapter). \nHereditary Nonpolyposis Syndrome (Lynch Syndrome)\nCertain families carry a genetic defect with a high degree of penetrance for colon cancer. The \ngenetic defect does not cause polyps, however. By definition, the syndrome is defined as:\n• Three family members in at least 2 generations with colon cancer\n• One of these cases should be premature, i.e., occurred in someone age <50\nPatients with this syndrome are also at increased risk for ovarian and endometrial cancer (up \nto 30%).\nScreening.  Start screening at age 25 and undergo colonoscopy every 1–2 years.\nHereditary Polyposis Syndromes\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis  has a very clear genetic defect. The adenomatous polyposis \ncoli gene (APC) confers 100% penetrance for the development of adenoma by age 35 and of \ncolon cancer by age 50. Polyps can be found as early as age 25. Start screening at age 12 and do \nflexible sigmoidoscopy every 1–2 years. As soon as polyps are found, perform a colectomy; a \nnew rectum should be made from the terminal ileum.\nBy contrast, juvenile polyposis syndrome  confers about a 10% risk of colon cancer. There are \nonly a few dozen polyps, as opposed to the thousands of polyps found in those with familial \n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   112 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

Hamartomas confer very little risk of developing into cancer. There is no specific \nrecommendation for screening.\nCowden syndrome  is another polyposis syndrome with hamartomas that gives only a slightly \nincreased risk of cancer compared with the general population. These polyposis syndromes \ncan present with rectal bleeding in a child.\nOther Polyposis and Colon Cancer Syndromes\nGardner syndrome  is the association of colon cancer with multiple, soft-tissue tumors, such as \nosteomas, lipomas, cysts, and fibrosarcomas. Osteomas are frequently found on the mandible. \nIf osteomas are found as an incidental finding on x-ray, do a colonoscopy.\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome  is the association of hamartomatous polyps in the large and small \nintestine with hyperpigmented spots. These are melanotic spots on the lips, buccal mucosa, \nand skin. The risk of cancer is slightly increased above the general population. Most common \npresentation is with abdominal pain due to intussusception/bowel obstruction.\nTurcot syndrome  is simply the association of colon cancer with central nervous system \nmalignancies.\nScreening. There is no recommendation for increased cancer screening for any of these \nsyndromes; they are not common enough to warrant a clear recommendation for uniform \nearly screening. There is an association of endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis  with colon \ncancer, so if a patient has endocarditis from S. bovis , colonoscopy should be performed.\nGASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING\nA 72-year-old man with a history of aortic stenosis is brought to the emergency \ndepartment with red/black stool several times today. His blood pressure is \n94/60  mm Hg and pulse 110/min.\nThe first thing to consider for a patient with GI bleed is the treatment, not the etiology.\n• Upper GI bleed  is most commonly caused by ulcer disease, gastritis, Mallory-Weiss \nsyndrome, esophagitis, and gastric cancer. By definition, upper GI bleed is defined as \nbleeding occurring proximal to the ligament of Treitz, which anatomically separates \nthe duodenum from the jejunum. If there is a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm \nrepair in the past 6 months to 1 year, consider aortoenteric fistula.\n• Variceal bleed  is common in those with portal hypertension from cirrhosis. \n• Lower GI bleed  is most commonly caused by diverticulosis, angiodysplasia (also know \nas AVM or vascular ectasia), hemorrhoids, cancer, and IBD. \nClinical Presentation. Typically, upper GI bleed presents with black stool or melena , while \nlower GI  bleed presents with red blood  in the stool. \n• Upper GI bleed can also cause hematemesis if the volume of bleeding is high enough.\n• About 10% of cases of red blood from the rectum can be from an upper GI source. \nThis can happen if the volume of blood is so high that it is rapidly transported to the \nbowel without time for it to oxidize and turn black. Note\nIf osteomas are seen as an \nincidental finding on x-ray, \nperform a colonoscopy.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   113 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

It is also defined as a >20-point drop in systolic blood pressure on \na change in position. There should be at least a minute in between the position change and the \nmeasurement of the pulse and blood pressure to allow time for the normal autonomic dis-\ncharge to accommodate to the position change. \nOrthostasis is when the rise in pulse or drop in blood pressure persists after the position has \nbeen changed. It indicates a 15–20% blood loss. The measurement of orthostatic changes is not \nnecessary in the patient described in this case because a pulse >100/min or a systolic blood \npressure <100/min already indicates a >30% blood loss. \nDiagnosis . Endoscopy is the most accurate test to determine the etiology of both upper and \nlower GI bleed. Barium study is always less accurate. Should biopsy be needed, an  endoscopy \nmust be performed. \nTreatment. The most important step in the initial  management  of severe GI bleeding is to \nbegin fluid resuscitation with normal saline or Ringer’s lactate. A complete blood count, pro -\nthrombin time, and type and crossmatch should be done, but if the patient is having a high vol -\nume bleed as in the patient above, never wait for the test results to begin fluid resuscitation.\n• If prothrombin time is elevated above the control, prothrombin concentrate complex \nshould be given, and IV vitamin K if on warfarin (replacing fresh frozen plasma)\n• Platelets should be transfused if platelet count <50,000/mm3 and if patient is actively \nbleeding\n• Nasogastric tube should not be used\nAll of the management described is more important than performing endoscopy to determine \na specific etiology. Fluids, blood, platelets, and plasma are indicated in all forms of severe GI \nbleeding if there is a coagulopathy. More than 80% of GI bleeding cases will stop spontane-\nously with appropriate fluid resuscitation, irrespective of the etiology.  Endoscopy is performed \nlater to determine the etiology.\nAcute  Bleeding. For acute bleeding, fluid resuscitation should be performed as described. The \nhematocrit should be maintained at ≥30% in older patients and those who may have coronary \nartery disease. Y ounger patients will form their own reticulocytes and make their own blood \nover a few days and do not need to be transfused, unless their hematocrit is closer to 20%. \nPatients with gastritis or the possibility of ulcer disease should be treated with PPIs empirically \nuntil a definitive diagnosis can be made. H2 blockers have no efficacy in acute GI bleeding.\nEsophageal varices are treated with octreotide during acute episodes of bleeding in order to \nlower portal pressure. If this is ineffective, emergency endoscopy should be performed to place \nbands around the bleeding varices. Sclerotherapy will also stop acutely bleeding varices, but \nthere is a much higher complication rate later on, such as stricture formation. If banding is not \neffective in stopping an acutely bleeding esophageal varix, then TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic \nportosystemic shunting) should be performed. A catheter is placed into the jugular vein and \nguided radiographically through the liver to form a shunt between the systemic circulation in \nthe hepatic vein and the portal circulation through the portal vein. TIPS has largely replaced \nthe need to surgically place the shunt. The most common, long-term complication of TIPS is \nworsening of hepatic encephalopathy.Note\nIn >80% of cases, GI bleeding \nwill resolve spontaneously with \nsupportive management, \nirrespective of etiology.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   114 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

Generally, lower GI bleeding presents with red blood in the stool, and \nupper GI bleeding presents with black stool, or melena.\nUpper GI bleeding can also give hematemesis if the volume of bleeding is high enough. About \n10% of cases of red blood from the rectum can be from an upper GI source.

In upper GI bleeding, occult blood–positive brown stool \ncan occur with as little as 5 to 10 mL of blood loss. The same is true of “coffee-ground” emesis. \nMelena develops when at least 100 mL of blood has been lost.\nOrthostasis is defined as a >10-point rise in pulse when the patient goes from the supine to the \nstanding or sitting position.

Endoscopy is the most accurate test to determine the etiology of both upper and \nlower GI bleeding. Barium studies are always less accurate. Y ou also cannot biopsy unless \nendoscopy is performed.\nOccasionally, in lower GI bleeding, endoscopy will not reveal the etiology even when there is \nactive bleeding. A nuclear bleeding scan can detect low volume bleeds 0.1–0.5 mL/min. Red \ncells from the patient are tagged with technetium and reinjected back into the patient. These \ntagged cells are then detected to determine the site of bleeding.\nAngiography is rarely used in the evaluation of lower GI bleeding because it needs a higher \nvolume of blood loss >0.5 mL/min compared with the tagged nuclear scan. Angiography, \nhowever, is useful in extremely high-volume bleeding in which so much blood is coming out \nthat endoscopy cannot see the source. It may then be used prior to either embolization of the \nsite of the bleeding or hemicolectomy. Angiography can also help guide the occasional use of a \nlocal vasopressin injection in the control of severe lower GI bleeding.Note\nConsider the treatment, not \nthe etiology, first when a \npatient is experiencing GI \nbleed.\nNote\nLower GI  bleeding presents \nwith red blood in the stool, \nwhereas upper GI  bleeding \npresents with black stool.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   115 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

This is often because the upper endoscope only goes as far as the ligament of Treitz, \nand the lower endoscope only reaches just past the ileocecal valve. When both of these \nmodalities are unrevealing, the most likely source of the bleeding is in the small bowel. The \nsmall bowel is very difficult to visualize, and barium studies are inaccurate.

To diagnose, there must be 2 of the following 3 features:\n• Acute onset of upper abdominal pain\n• Amylase or lipase >3x the upper limit of normal\n• Evidence on imaging\nThe initial tests remain as amylase and lipase (lipase is more specific to the pancreas than is \namylase). CT scan should not be given routinely; only do if pancreatitis is severe, lasts longer \nthan 48 hours, or complications are suspected.\nThe most important sign of severe pancreatitis and poor prognosis is elevated or raising BUN. \nHypertriglyceridemia can give a falsely normal amylase and lipase levels.\nThe most accurate test to determine the severity of pancreatitis is the CT scan, which is more \naccurate than a sonogram for detecting the presence of inflammation, necrosis,  pseudo-cysts, \nabscesses, and ductal stones. The APACHE score is also used to stratify acute pancreatitis.\nThe single most accurate test for the detection of biliary and pancreatic ductal pathology is \nERCP . \nTreatment.  Treat with aggressive IV fluids (250–500 mL/hr), bowel rest, and pain medication \n(use morphine, as it does not constrict the sphincter of Oddi, and never use meperidine \n[black box warning label for seizures]).\n• Aggressive IV fluids are most beneficial in first 12–24 hours and may be harmful after \nthat time; reduce after 24 hours (Lactated Ringer’s is preferred over normal saline \nbased on clinical data).\n• Resume oral feeding as soon as pain and nausea resolve; no need to wait.\n• Administer antibiotics only if evidence of infected necrosis based on biopsy;  \ndo not give antibiotics for necrosis without infection .\n• Do ERCP only if ascending cholangitis or nonresolving biliary obstruction , as it \ncan otherwise worsen pancreatitis.\nFor gallstone pancreatitis, do cholecystectomy prior to discharge.\nFor severe acute pancreatitis that does not resolve within 72 hours, give enteral feeding via \nNGT or nasojejunal feeds, not total parental nutrition. Data shows that enteral feeding \nimproves mortality (vs parental). Do not keep patient NPO after 72 hours, as that leads to \nincreased risk for sepsis and death. \n• When pancreatitis is very severe, e.g., >30% necrosis visible on CT, the risk of infected \nand hemorrhagic pancreatitis markedly increases. \n• Severe necrosis, particularly when there is persistent fever, is also an indication to \nperform a percutaneous needle biopsy of the pancreas. If infection of the pancreas \naccompanies the necrosis, imipenem and urgent surgical debridement are  indicated.\n• Antibiotics should not be routinely given for pancreatic necrosis; they should be \nreserved for those with proven infection.\n• If patient does not improve or deteriorates 7–10 days after presentation, perform \nCT-guided fine-needle aspiration.Note\nSigns of Severe Necrotizing \nPancreatitis\nCullen sign:  blue discoloration \naround umbilicus → due to \nhemoperitoneum\nTurner’s sign:  bluish purple \ndiscoloration of the flanks → \ntissue catabolism of Hb.\nNote\nIV fluid intake in large volumes \nis the most important \nmanagement of acute \npancreatitis; it must be given \nin the first 12–24 hours . \nNote\nOther complications of \npancreatitis include:  \n• Ascites (high in amylase)\n• Pleural effusion (transudate, \nincreased amylase)\n• Splenic vein thrombosis \n(think when there are \ngastric varices but no \nesophageal varices)\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   117 16/05/19   10:39 AM",

The regenerative capacity of the liver is enormous; however, over a long time, \nfibrosis will develop. And when at least 70–80% of liver function has been lost, the synthetic \ncapacity of the liver is diminished. \nIn the United States the most common cause of cirrhosis is alcohol. Other causes include \nprimary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemochroma-\ntosis, and Wilson disease.\nThe complications of cirrhosis are due to portal hypertension. Portal hypertension develops \nbecause of mechanical factors of fibrosis and regenerative liver nodules, as well as increased \nintrahepatic vascular resistance in increased portal inflow. The high pressure in the portal vein \nis decompressed through collateral portosystemic shunts that occur in the esophagus and the \nstomach. \nClinical Presentation . Despite the etiology, all forms of cirrhosis have the following  features:\n• Low albumin\n• Portal hypertension\n• Esophageal varices\n• Ascites\n• Peripheral edema\n• Elevated prothrombin time (prolonged due to loss of ability to synthesize clotting \nfactors)\n• Splenomegaly\n• Thrombocytopenia\n• Spider angiomata\n• Palmar erythema\n• Asterixis\n• Encephalopathy (possible)\n• Jaundice (possible)\nAll of the clotting factors are made in the liver (except factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, \nmade by endothelial cells). If factor VIII is low in addition to other factors, it is not liver \ndisease—think disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) .\nAscites is the result of portal hypertension. A paracentesis is a sample of the ascitic fluid \nobtained by needle through the anterior abdominal wall. A paracentesis is used to exclude \ninfection, as well as to determine the etiology of the ascites if it is not clear from the history.\nSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is an idiopathic infection of ascites. The Gram stain is \nrarely positive because the density of microorganisms is so low. Although culture of the fluid is \nthe most specific test, do not wait for the results to make a decision as to whether to give \nantibiotics. The presence of >250/mm3 neutrophils  are the criteria to determine the presence \nof infection. Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for SBP ,  and albumin infusion \nwill decrease the risk of hepatorenal syndrome.Note\nWhile alcohol is the most \ncommon cause of cirrhosis in \nthe United States, the most \ncommon reason to need a \nliver transplant is chronic \nhepatitis C.\n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   119 16/05/19   10:40 AM",

Although it is more often found with \nulcerative colitis, it can also occur with Crohn’s disease. Cancer of the biliary system can \ndevelop in 15% of patients from the chronic inflammation.\nClinical Presentation and Diagnosis. The presentation and general lab tests are typically the \nsame as those for primary biliary cirrhosis, except that the antimitochondrial antibody test will \nbe negative. The most specific test for primary sclerosis cholangitis is ERCP or MRCP: “string \nof beads of MRCP or ERCP . ” This is the only chronic liver disease in which a liver biopsy is not \nthe most accurate test.\nTreatment.  Treat with endoscopic therapy for strictures; cholestyramine for itching. \nHemochromatosis\nHemochromatosis is one of the most common inherited genetic diseases. There is an overab -\nsorption of iron in the duodenum, leading to iron buildup in tissue throughout the body, thus \nresulting in chronic hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Presentation includes the  following:\n• Cirrhosis (most common finding)\n• Hepatocellular cancer (15–20% of patients)\n• Restrictive cardiomyopathy (15% of patients)\n• Arthralgias, osteoarthritis in the MPC joints, osteophytes on x-ray , skin hyperpig -\nmentation, diabetes, and secondary hypogonadism (decreased libido and impotence)\n• Vibrio vulnificus  and Yersinia  infections occur with increased frequency because of \ntheir avidity for iron.\nScreening for hemochromatosis is made with elevated transferrin saturation >55%. Ferritin is \nalso elevated. C282Y homozygous and C282Y/H63D are diagnostic of hemochromatosis and \ndo need a liver biopsy for diagnosis.\nThe most accurate test is a liver biopsy.\nTreatment.  Phlebotomy is used to remove large amounts of iron from the body—it removes \nfar more iron than do the chelating agents deferoxamine and deferasirox. Deferoxamine and \ndeferasirox are used only for those who cannot undergo phlebotomy.\nWilson Disease\nWilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder leading to a diminished ability to excrete \ncopper from the body. There is also increased copper absorption from the small intestine.\n• Copper builds up in the liver, brain, and cornea. \n• Basal ganglia dysfunction contributes to the movement disorder which develops. \n• Psychiatric disturbance is seen in 10% of patients.\n• Kayser-Fleischer rings are found in the eye on slit-lamp examination. \n• Tremor and Parkinson result in 35% of patients. Note\nPrimary sclerosis cholangitis is \nthe only chronic liver disease \nin which a liver biopsy is not \nthe most accurate test .\nNote\nFerritin is elevated in liver \ndisease and alcoholics. \nTransferrin saturation  is the \nbest screening test; if it is \nnegative, diagnosis is not \nhemochromatosis . \n04_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch04.indd   122 16/05/19   10:40 AM",

There is also increased urinary copper. The single most specific test is liver biopsy, \nwhich will demonstrate increased copper deposition in the liver. Occasionally, hemolytic \nanemia is seen when copper levels go high and are toxic to the red cells.\nTreatment.  Penicillamine and trientine are copper chelators. Oral zinc interferes with copper \nabsorption. Steroids will not help. Liver transplantation is curative.\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal recessive condition which causes a \nlow level (or no level) of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in the blood. The condition is found in all \nethnic groups but occurs most often in whites of European ancestry. AAT protects the lungs \nso they can have normal function. AAT is made in the liver; without enough of it, the lungs \nbecome damaged, leading to emphysema.\n• Everyone has 2 copies of the gene for AAT and receives 1 copy of the gene from each \nparent.\n• Patients with AATD have 1 normal copy and 1 damaged copy, or they have 2 dam -\naged copies.\n –Most patients with 1 normal gene can produce enough AAT to live healthy lives, \nespecially if they do not smoke.\n –Those with 2 damaged copies of the gene are generally not able to produce enough \nAAT, leading them to have more severe symptoms.\nThe most prominent finding is emphysema developing at a young age in a nonsmoker. Approxi -\nmately 15% of those with AATD develop cirrhosis. Large amounts of abnormal AAT are made \nin the liver; nearly 85% of this protein accumulates in the liver causing inflammation and \neventually, fibrosis.\nDiagnosis. Testing for AATD, using a blood sample from the individual, is simple, quick and \nhighly accurate. Three types of tests are usually done on the serum sample:\n• Alpha-1 genotyping, which examines a person’s genes and determines his genotype\n• AAT PI type of phenotype test, which determines the type of AAT protein a person \nhas\n• AAT level test, which determines the amount of AAT in a person’s blood\nTreatment.  There is no specific therapy for the liver disease. Those with emphysema should \nreceive replacement of the enzyme and stop smoking.\nChronic Hepatitis B and C\nHepatitis B and C are transmitted by blood products, needlestick injury, and sexual contact. \nInjection drug use is also strongly associated with both viruses.Note\nA patient presenting with \nchoreoathetoid movements \nand psychosis gives the clue to \nperform the slit-lamp \nexamination.

Patients presenting with this symptom may either \nhave an underlying cause that is benign and requires only moderate analgesic medication or is \nlife-threatening (e.g., acute myocardial ischemia or aortic dissection) which mandates prompt \ndiagnosis and treatment. \nIn the evaluation of chest pain, the focus should be on excluding the more serious conditions .\nHistory\nAssessing the setting in which the chest pain occurs  is one of the most important aspects of the \nevaluation. The healthy 26-year-old medical resident with chest pain that occurred after on-call is \nunlikely to have cardiovascular disease, no matter the quality or duration of chest pain. The \n58-year-old man who has type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia with chest discomfort of any type has \na much higher probability for cardiac-related chest pain.\nOverall, the chest pain history is more useful  than the physical examination. Important aspects \nof the history include duration, quality, location, radiation, frequency, alleviating or precipitating \nfactors (especially exercise), and associated symptoms.Cardiology 5\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   125 20/05/19   4:26 PM",

Nausea and \nvomiting are sometimes the main symptoms in inferoposterior wall ischemia (also, vagal \nreflexes may cause bradycardia and hypotension, presenting as dizziness or fainting).\n• “Sharp” or “knife-like” chest pain and pain which the patient can pinpoint to an \n“exact area” are less likely to be related to ischemia or infarction, especially if the chest \npain is reproduced by changes in position or palpation.\n• Myocardial infarction is associated with pain that lasts >20–30 minutes in duration.\n• Response of chest pain to nitroglycerin (within a few minutes) is most consistent with \ntransient ischemia or esophageal spasm. Chest pain that worsens with nitroglycerin \nsometimes occurs with gastroesophageal reflux disease. The response to nitroglycerin \nis not enough to confirm coronary disease as the cause of chest pain.\n• Acute coronary syndromes in women often present without “classic” symptoms: \ninstead, they may have dyspnea, shortness of breath, fatigue.\nPhysical Examination\nOne of the most important parts in a chest pain examination is the “initial impression. ” \n• Diaphoresis, tachypnea, and anxious expression should alert you to a potentially \nlife-threatening process. \n• Tachycardia and tachypnea are both nonspecific but occur in almost all cases of \npulmonary embolism.\n• Check BP in both arms: a difference >20 mm Hg systolic suggests aortic dissection \n(present in ~70% of cases).\n• Hypotension may suggest massive pulmonary embolism or cardiac shock.\n• Fever may suggest pneumonia or mediastinitis (esophageal rupture) as the cause of \nchest pain.\n• Evidence of atherosclerosis (corneal lipid rings, narrowed retinal arteries, and pigment \nand hair changes in the legs) is commonly seen in patients with coronary syndromes.\nInspect the chest wall for tender areas, respiratory motion, respiratory retractions, or accessory \nmuscle use. If the tender area corresponds to the location of the patient’s pain and palpation \nexactly reproduces the pain, consider musculoskeletal chest pain as the cause of chest pain.\nAbnormal heart sounds and new murmurs are commonly found in certain chest pain syndromes. \n• Wide physiologic splitting of the second heart sound (splitting wider with inspiration) \ncan be found in right bundle branch block or in right ventricular infarction.\n• New paradoxical splitting is most often due to left bundle branch block (LBBB), or \nanterior or lateral infarction. \n• A new fourth heart sound can occur with angina or infarction. An S3 is more likely \ndue to underlying heart failure. \n• A new murmur may be significant: aortic regurgitation occurs in over half of patients \nwith aortic dissection, while mitral regurgitation can occur in patients with angina or \ninfarction and is due to papillary muscle dysfunction.\nThe lungs should be auscultated for crackles and asymmetrical breath sounds. Asymmetry of \nbreath sounds may be found in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Absent lung sounds \nalso may occur in pneumothorax and pleural effusions.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   126 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

Absence of pedal pulses may occur in aortic dissection. Calf swelling or edema raises \nthe odds of pulmonary embolism as the cause of chest pain.\nTesting\nAll patients with chest pain should have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG ) since the ECG is \nthe single most important test  to evaluate the cause. It should be done immediately after \ninitial stabilization and taking of vital signs. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, the \nECG is the sole test required to select patients for emergency reperfusion.\nMost patients with myocardial infarction will have an abnormal initial ECG:\n• 50% with acute MI will have diagnostic findings (ST elevation, new LBBB, or Q waves)\n• 35% will have findings consistent with ischemia (ST depression and/or T wave \ninversion)\n• In patients presenting with acute chest pain who have normal ECG , the chance of \nacute MI is much less than 10% (in some studies 1–2.6%). \n• An abnormal ECG can be seen in many non-cardiac conditions (pulmonary embo -\nlism, electrolyte abnormalities, aortic dissection).\nSerum cardiac biomarker  determinations play a vital role in the evaluation of patients who \npresent with acute chest pain and in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Serum mark -\ners such as aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase subforms \nno longer are used because they lack cardiac specificity and their delayed elevation precludes \nearly diagnosis. Creatine kinase (CK) is found in striated muscle and tissues of the brain, \nkidney, lung, and GI tract. This marker has low sensitivity and specificity for cardiac damage, \nand total CK levels may be elevated in a number of noncardiac conditions, including trauma, \nseizures, renal insufficiency, hyperthermia, and hyperthyroidism. As a result, the total CK \nmarker largely has been replaced by cardiac troponins and CK-MB.\nCK-MB isoenzyme:  CK-MB is cardiac specific and is useful for the early diagnosis of acute \nmyocardial infarction. CK-MB typically is detectable in the serum 4–6 hours after the onset of \nischemia, peaks in 12–24 hours, and normalizes in 2–3 days.\nLike the CK level, the peak CK-MB level does not predict infarct size ; however, it can be used \nto detect early reinfarction since it normalizes 2-3 days after the initial MI. Serial CK-MB \nlevels commonly are obtained at admission to the emergency department and are repeated in \n6–12 hours.\nCK-MB subform (not routinely used): CK-MB may be further characterized into subforms \n(or isoforms). CK-MB2 is found in myocardial tissue, and CK-MB1 is found in plasma. \nCardiac troponins:  Troponins (T, I, C) are found in striated and cardiac muscle. Because the \ncardiac and skeletal muscle isoforms of troponin T and I differ, they are known as the “cardiac \ntroponins. ” They are the preferred markers  for the diagnosis of myocardial injury. Troponin T \nand I have similar sensitivity for the detection of myocardial injury, but unlike troponin I \nlevels, troponin T may be elevated in patients with renal disease, polymyositis, or dermato-\nmyositis. Thus, troponin I is preferred in most settings.Note\nMake every effort to obtain a \nprevious ECG for comparison. \nAny ECG finding is assumed to \nbe new unless proven \notherwise by an old ECG (if \none is available).\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   127 20/05/19   4:27 PM",
    "page_135": "128\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nThe cardiac troponins typically are measured at emergency department admission and \nrepeated in 6–12 hours. Patients with a normal CK-MB level but elevated troponin levels are \nconsidered to have sustained minor myocardial damage , or microinfarction, whereas patients \nwith elevations of both CK-MB and troponins are considered to have had acute myocardial \ninfarction. The cardiac troponins may remain elevated up to 2 weeks  after symptom onset, \nwhich makes them useful as late markers of recent acute myocardial infarction.\nAn elevated troponin T or I is helpful for identifying patients at increased risk for death or the \ndevelopment of acute myocardial infarction. Increased risk is related to the high serum troponin \nlevels. The troponins also can help identify low-risk patients who may be sent home with close \nfollow-up. Those with a normal or nearly normal ECG and a normal troponin I test 6 hours \nafter admission had a very low risk of major cardiac events (0.3%) during the next 30 days.\nMyoglobin  levels begin to rise as early as 1–4 hours after the onset of pain.

In nearly all cases, \nthe reduction in blood flow is caused by coronary atherosclerotic disease. \nWhen the atherosclerotic plaque ruptures, there is superimposed thrombus formation that \nacutely occludes the artery; this is the most common cause of life-threatening acute coronary \nsyndromes.\nRarely, other abnormalities may occur (coronary artery embolism, coronary artery spasm, \ncoronary arteritis, and coronary artery dissection) which may cause IHD in the absence of \natheroma formation.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   130 20/05/19   4:27 PM",
    "page_138": "131\nChapter 5   ●  Cardiology\nIHD is one of the most prevalent diseases in society, and those affected are likely to die from \ntheir disease (though age-specific deaths have declined over the past 30 years). As part of a \nsystemic process that involves all arteries in the body, it is an insidious process that begins in \nearly adulthood with fatty streaks; these lesions progress into plaques and thrombus formation \nin middle age.\nIschemic Heart Disease\nSymptomatic\nRuptured\nplaque\nAtherosclerotic\nplaqueThrombosis\nformationClinically Silent\n(asymptomatic)\nMediaStable angina\n(symptoms with\nexertion)Acute coronary syndromes:\n• Unstable angina\n• Non ST-segment elevation MI\n• ST-segment elevation MI\nProgression of\natherosclerotic plaqueIntima\nAtherosclerotic\nplaque\nFigure 5-2.

For example, a person with \ntotal cholesterol 260 mg/dL has a greater risk than someone with total cholesterol 220 mg/dL, \neven though all people with total cholesterol ≥220 mg/dL are considered high risk.\nMajor Modifiable Risk Factors\nElevated cholesterol levels:  The risk of IHD rises as blood cholesterol levels increase. The \nconcentrations of lipid fractions, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL), are also important. LDL cholesterol is the single most important sub-\ngroup  that carries risk for IHD, although there are several other abnormalities that increase \ncoronary risk: low HDL cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, increased total-to-HDL-cholesterol \nratio and increased lipoprotein A. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and \ntobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   131 20/05/19   4:27 PM",
    "page_139": "132\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nProof of the importance of serum cholesterol has come from randomized trials, which showed \nthat reductions in total LDL levels reduce coronary events and mortality.\nTobacco: Cigarette smoking is an important factor for IHD because a smoker’s risk of heart \nattack is >2x that of a nonsmoker. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors (hyper -\ntension, dyslipidemia) to greatly increase the risk for IHD.\n• Cigar or pipe smokers have a higher risk of death from IHD, though less than \n cigarette smokers.\n• Secondhand smoke or passive smoking increases the risk of heart disease, even for \nnonsmokers.\n• The risk for myocardial infarction in those who quit smoking was reduced to that of \nnonsmokers within 2 years of cessation; the benefits were seen regardless of how long \nor how much the patient smoked.\nHypertension (HTN):  HTN is a well-established risk factor for increase in risk of myocardial \nischemia, stroke, kidney failure, and heart failure. Studies in the general population have \nshown that the risk for cardiovascular events increases at BP >110/75 mm Hg. Systolic BP is as \nimportant as diastolic BP in terms of risk for IHD, especially in older patients.\nTreatment of HTN to optimal levels reduces the risk of IHD and all cardiovascular events. In \nfact, data from recent randomized trials suggest that reducing BP below 130/80 mm Hg is \nbeneficial in patients with cardiovascular disease and those with calculated 10-year cardiovas-\ncular risk >10%.\nPhysical inactivity and exercise:  Inactivity and sedentary lifestyle are risk factors for IHD. \nExercise of moderate degree has a protective effect against IHD and cardiovascular events. \nMore vigorous activities are associated with more benefits. Physical activity can help increase \nHDL cholesterol and control diabetes and obesity, as well as help to lower blood pressure.\nObesity:  Patients with increased body fat (elevated body mass index), especially if a lot is in \nthe waist area, are more likely to develop heart IHD and stroke. Excess weight raises blood \npressure, blood cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and it lowers HDL cholesterol levels. It can \nalso increase risk for type 2 diabetes by causing insulin resistance.\nStudies have shown that loss of as little as 10–20 lb can significantly reduce the risk of cardio-\nvascular disease.\nDiabetes mellitus:  Elevated blood glucose levels and insulin resistance are associated with \nIHD and overall cardiovascular events. All-cause mortality in diabetic patients is comparable \nto that of all-cause mortality in patients with prior myocardial ischemia; hence, diabetes is now \nconsidered an “IHD equivalent. ” Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes greatly \nincreases the risk of IHD. Almost 75% of patients with diabetes die of some form of cardio -\nvascular disease.\nThere is compelling evidence that aggressive treatment of HTN and cholesterol, as well as tight \nglycemic control, reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in these patients significantly.\nMajor Unmodifiable Risk Factors\nAge:  Four out of 5 people who die of IHD are age ≥65. Also, women who develop myocardial \nischemia at older ages have a higher mortality than men within the first few weeks of the \ncardiac event.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   132 20/05/19   4:27 PM",
    "page_140": "133\nChapter 5   ●  Cardiology\nSex: Men have a greater risk of IHD than women, and overall they develop cardiovascular \ndisease earlier in life.\nHeredity:  Family history is a significant independent risk factor if there is a family history of \npremature disease (age <55 in male relative and <65 in female relative).\nMinor Contributing Risk Factors\nSex hormones:  Men have more heart attacks than women before menopause. Several studies \nshow that the decrease of natural estrogen as women age may contribute to a higher risk of \nheart disease after menopause.\nStress:  Various studies have shown relationship between IHD risk and stress in a person’s life. \nThis may be a true association or just a secondary correlation: for example, people under stress \nmay overeat, start smoking, or be less active than people who are not under stress.\nMyocardial Ischemia As a Manifestation of IHD\nDuring ischemia, an imbalance occurs between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. \nIschemia may manifest in any of the following ways:\n• Anginal chest discomfort\n• ST-segment deviation on ECG\n• Reduced uptake of tracer during myocardial perfusion scanning\n• Regional or global impairment of ventricular function\nMyocardial ischemia can be caused by increased myocardial oxygen demand, reduced \n myocardial oxygen supply, or both. In the presence of coronary obstruction, an increase of \nmyocardial oxygen requirements caused by exercise, tachycardia, or emotion leads to a \ntransitory imbalance. (This condition is called  “demand ischemia”  and is responsible for most \nepisodes of chronic stable angina.)\nIn other situations, the imbalance is caused by acute reduction of oxygen supply secondary to \nmarked reduction or cessation of coronary flow as a result of platelet aggregates or thrombi. \nThis condition ( “supply ischemia” ) is responsible for myocardial infarction (MI) and most \nepisodes of unstable angina (UA). In many circumstances, ischemia results from both an \nincrease in oxygen demand and a reduction in supply.\nAngina (Stable Angina)\nA 62-year-old man presents with substernal chest pain that occurs with exertion and \nis relieved by rest. He has been having this on and off for 8 months, and the last \nepisode occurred 3 days ago while he was running to the bus. He has a history of \nwell-controlled diabetes and dyslipidemia. Vital signs, physical examination, and \nECG are normal. An exercise stress test shows a 2-mm ST depression.\nStable angina occurs when the myocardium becomes ischemic. This occurs during periods of \nincreased demand for oxygen, such as exercise, or decreased supply, such as hypotension or \n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   133 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

It may be accompanied by radiation to the jaw, neck, shoulders, or arms. It is \nless likely to have the symptoms often associated with MI: sweats, nausea, and shortness of \nbreath. Anginal pain is not typically affected by respiration or by position. Typically, patients \nwith stable angina will have pain after a predictable amount of exertion and will have identical \nsymptoms with each attack.\nIn certain patients, symptoms other than pain may occur. For example, a profound sense of \nweakness and breathlessness may be an “angina equivalent. ” These symptoms are more likely to \noccur in women, the elderly, and diabetics.\nThe physical exam is usually normal. A new S4 may be heard, suggesting a stiff ventricle due to \nischemia.\nMost patients with angina will have ECG changes during an attack . Most commonly, ST \nsegment depression is seen. ST segment elevation occurs in variant angina (Prinzmetal angina) \nwhere coronary artery spasm is responsible and rarely during ischemia caused by stable angina \n(where atherosclerotic disease is responsible).\nDiagnosis.  The exercise stress test (EST) (treadmill test) is the most useful test for evaluating \nthe cause of chronic chest pain when there is concern about IHD (stable angina). EST provides \na controlled environment for observing the effects of increases in the myocardial demand for \noxygen. To do an appropriate and accurate analysis, a target heart rate must be reached. Target \nheart rate is 85% of predicted maximum heart rate: 85% × (220 – patient’s age ).\nSignificant fixed stenoses  (>50%) of the coronary arteries will result in ECG evidence of \nischemia. Low-grade stenoses (<50%) may not produce sufficient impairment of blood flow to \naffect the ECG; in these cases the stress test will be normal. \nAn EST is considered positive for myocardial ischemia when large (>2 mm) ST-segment \ndepressions or hypotension (a drop >10 mm Hg in systolic pressure) occur either alone or in \ncombination. In general, the earlier the angina or ECG abnormalities occur, the more signifi -\ncant they will be. The exercise stress testing can help to do the following:\n• Determine the severity of IHD and the need for further intervention, i.e., severe symp -\ntoms (hypotension) early in the test usually occur in those with triple-vessel disease\n• Assess the effectiveness of treatment, i.e., coronary artery disease patients who have \nundergone surgical intervention or are receiving medical therapy have an exercise \nstress test when they are medically stable and symptom-free\n• Determine functional capacity and identify any ECG changes or symptoms during \n(low level) exercise for patients who are post-MI\nEST is contraindicated when it may place the patient at increased risk of cardiac instability, \ne.g., aortic dissection, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or symptomatic \n supraventricular arrhythmia.\nPatients who are unable to exercise or walk should be considered for chemical stress testing , \nsuch as dipyridamole (Persantine) or dobutamine stress test. Presence of baseline ECG \nabnormalities such as bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or with a pacemaker, \nmay make it more difficult to interpret test results. In those cases patients should be evaluated \nby nuclear stress imaging instead of the exercise stress test. These tests may also be used in \npatients who are taking digoxin.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   134 20/05/19   4:27 PM",
    "page_142": "135\nChapter 5   ●  Cardiology\nIn most cases, medications should not be withheld in preparation for an exercise stress test. \nCertain medications require special consideration:\n• Beta blockers may blunt the heart rate during exercise and thus should be held \n24 hours prior to the test. While patients receiving beta blockers may perform the \nexercise required for the test, the usual age-adjusted target heart rate may not be a \nrealistic end point for them.\n• Also, the antihypertensive effect of beta blockers, alpha blockers, and nitroglycerin \nmay cause significant hypotension during exercise.\nDigoxin may depress the ST segments, so if ST-segment depression of ≥1 mm is present on \nbaseline ECG, the stress test results will be difficult to interpret.\nA number of other situations or conditions may reduce the validity of the exercise stress test. \nExercise testing in asymptomatic, young women  yields an increased number of false-positive \nresults, while exercise testing in patients with known CAD may result in an unacceptably high \nfalse-negative rate (e.g., a negative stress test in a 64-year-old man with diabetes, hyperlipid-\nemia, and typical stable angina is likely to be a false-negative result).\nA 29-year-old woman has a routine stress test done that shows a 1-mm ST depression. \nShe has no history of chest pain, and she exercises routinely (runs 2–3 miles per day, \n3 times per week). Her physical examination is unremarkable.\nThe most likely  cause of her abnormal stress test? False-positive test.\nOther types of stress tests include:\n• Nuclear stress test:  A radioactive substance is injected into the patient and perfusion \nof heart tissue is visualized. The perfusion pictures are done both at rest and after \nexercise. An abnormal amount of thallium will be seen in those areas of the heart that \nhave a decreased blood supply. Compared to regular stress tests, the nuclear stress \ntests have higher sensitivity and specificity (92% sensitivity, 95% specificity vs. 67% \nsensitivity, 70% specificity). These tests are also not affected by baseline changes in the \nECG (LBBB, ST-segment depression at baseline, etc.).\n• Dobutamine or adenosine stress test:  Used in people who are unable to exercise. A \ndrug is given to induce tachycardia, as if the person were exercising.\n• Stress echocardiogram:  Combines a treadmill stress test and an echocardiogram \n(ECHO). The latter can recognize abnormal movement of the walls of the left ventricle \n(wall motion abnormalities) that are induced by exercise.\nInvasive techniques:  Cardiac catheterization is also used in patients with stable angina for \n(1) diagnosis and ( 2) prognosis/risk stratification. Angiography is an appropriate diagnostic \ntest when noninvasive tests are contraindicated or inadequate due to the patient’s illness or \nphysical characteristics (e.g., morbid obesity, COPD). Cardiac angiography is also used after \nconventional stress tests are positive to identify patients that will benefit from stent placement \nor bypass surgery.\nTreatment. For individual episodes of angina, nitroglycerin (NTG) sublingual tablets typically \nalleviate the pain within 3 minutes. Long-term management is with long-acting nitrates and/or \nbeta blockers. Other medications patients with stable angina should be taking, unless contrain-\ndicated, include aspirin and statins (for lipid lowering). Also, modify the risk factors (tobacco \ncessation, exercise, control of hypertension, etc.).\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   135 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

Most patients will require both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic \ninterventions to reach target goals. \nTarget goals for hyperlipidemic patients with coronary artery disease include: \n• LDL <100 mg/dL\n• HDL ≥40 mg/dL\n• Triglycerides <150 mg/dL\nThe optimal LDL-cholesterol goal is considered to be <70 mg/dL for patients considered to be \nvery high risk . These are patients with established cardiovascular disease plus diabetes and \npatients with acute coronary syndromes. \nEvery effort should be made to ensure that patients with coronary artery disease receive \noptimal lipid therapy. Statin medications are strongly supported as first-line medications due \nto compelling evidence of mortality reduction from multiple clinical trials. If patients are \nintolerant to a statin, consider other statins in reduced doses.\nBetter medical therapy with aspirin, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins are decreasing \nthe need for all revascularization procedures.\nPercutaneous coronary intervention\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is most useful in acute coronary syndrome. It is not \nrequired for most cases of stable angina. (Recent studies have shown that most patients with \nstable angina can be medically managed.)\nCoronary bypass graft\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is recommended for patients with obstructive \ncoronary artery disease whose survival will be improved compared to medical therapy or \npercutaneous coronary intervention. Typically, this means patients with left main disease or \ntriple-vessel disease and low ejection fraction. In addition, patients with angina refractory to \nmedical therapy qualify for CABG.\nCABG is more efficacious in diabetics and in those who have a low ejection fraction. The \nprocedure involves the construction of 1 or more grafts between the arterial and coronary \ncirculations. (Many patients receive both arterial and venous grafts.) Long-term graft patency \nis significantly better with the arterial graph (e.g., internal mammary artery). Potential \nconsequences of graft failure (loss of patency) include the development of angina, myocardial \ninfarction, or cardiac death.Note\nAlmost all patients with \nchronic stable coronary artery \ndisease will likely need statin \ntherapy, unless \ncontraindicated.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   136 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

All of the above\nAnswer: E\nACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME\nAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) describes a range of thrombotic coronary diseases, includ-\ning unstable angina (UA) , non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) , and \n ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) . Collectively they represent one of the most \ncommon causes of acute medical admission to U.S. hospitals.\nThe term ACS  is clinically useful because the initial presentation and early management of \nunstable angina, STEMI, and NSTEMI are frequently similar. ACS should be distinguished \nfrom stable angina, which develops during exertion and resolves at rest.\nACS is due to coronary vessel atherosclerotic obstruction with superimposed thrombotic \nocclusion. The natural course of coronary atherosclerotic plaque development and subsequent \nocclusion does not proceed in a step-wise, uniform manner, gradually progressing to luminal \nobstruction (and symptoms) over many years. This process is characterized by plaque disrup-\ntion and mural thrombosis. Angiographic data support the concept that noncritical lesions \naccount for the majority of the ACS. Thus, the pathogenic rate-limiting mechanism of the ACS \nappears to be acute thrombosis and the resultant obstruction of the coronary lumen.\nAn operational classification is clinically helpful since it allows the simple distinction of the \ndifferent types of ACS. In this classification, the ECG is the most important clinical tool. The \ninitial ECG findings, in particular, the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation, will \nfurther define the patient’s condition and dictate treatment options.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   137 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

Experts also regard any new-onset angina  as unstable. Sudden change in the \npattern of angina usually means a physical change within the coronary arteries, such as hemor -\nrhage into an atherosclerotic plaque or rupture of a plaque with intermittent thrombus formation.\nAbout 35% of patients with the clinical syndrome of UA will already have coronary thrombosis \non catheterization. In fact, untreated UA progresses to MI in 50% of cases, thus the patient \nwith new-onset or unstable angina should be hospitalized for intensive medical treatment.\nMost patients with NSTEMI have a normal physical examination.

Antiplatelet therapy \n(beyond aspirin):  Early treatment should be initiated with aspirin and clopidogrel, prasugrel, \nor ticagrelor with the following considerations:\n• Avoid clopidogrel in patients likely to require emergency coronary bypass surgery. \nPrasugrel and ticagrelor are alternatives to clopidogrel.\n• If possible, discontinue clopidogrel 5 days before coronary bypass surgery.\nAntithrombin therapy:  Give unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous enoxaparin until \nangiography or for 48–72 hours.

Women with \nPrinzmetal tend to have few risk factors for CAD, though many have a history of migraine \nheadaches (another condition associated with arterial spasm).\nExercise testing and routine coronary angiography usually give normal results.

These changes serve as compensatory mechanisms to help maintain \n cardiac output (primarily by the Frank-Starling mechanism) and arterial blood pressure (by \n systemic vasoconstriction). However, these compensatory changes over time can worsen  cardiac \nfunction.

Compensatory mecha -\nnisms during HF include:\n• Cardiac:  Frank-Starling mechanism, tachycardia, ventricular dilatation\n• Neuronal:  increased sympathetic adrenergic activity, reduced cardiac vagal activity\n• Hormonal:  activation of angiotensin-aldosterone system with renal sodium retention \nand ECV expansion), vasopressin, catecholamines, and natriuretic peptides\nIn clinical practice, HF is commonly categorized by whether the abnormality is due to contraction \nor relaxation of the heart. Systolic HF  (systolic dysfunction) is due to a loss of contractile strength \nof the myocardium accompanied by ventricular dilatation. This type of HF is also accompanied by \na decrease in normal ventricular emptying (usually ejection fraction <45%). Examples of systolic \nHF include ischemic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy (Case 1 in this section).\nHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction  (diastolic dysfunction) occurs when the filling \nof one or both ventricles is impaired while the emptying capacity is normal (echocardiogram \nconfirms that the ejection fraction is normal).

The kidneys retain salt and water, worsening the EVC \nexpansion.  Pulmonary edema  develops when the rate of fluid accumulation goes above the \nrate of lymphatic absorption. Pulmonary edema is detected by audible crackles, increased JVP \nand edema on exam, and chest x-ray findings.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   151 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

They \nimprove survival and reduce ventricular hypertrophy—and eventually, symptoms. ACE \ninhibitors through vasodilation reduce preload and afterload, thereby reducing right atrial, \npulmonary arterial, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. All ACE inhibitors have been \nstudied and are considered equal in terms of HF treatment. Angiotensin receptor blockers \n(ARB) are acceptable alternatives if the patient is unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors (cough, \nangioedema).\nNewer drugs include:\n• Combination drug valsartan-sacubitril, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor \n(ARNI) . Valsartan is an ARB, while sacubitril inhibits the degradation of natriuretic \npeptide. Neprilysin is a neutral endopeptidase that degrades several vasoactive \npeptides, including natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP) and bradykinin. Inhibition of \nneprilysin increases levels of these substances, which then counteract the effects of \nneurohormonal activation such as vasoconstriction and sodium retention. They block \nthe RAAS system and lead to natriuresis and decrease cardiac hypertrophy and \nfibrosis.\n• Ivabradine , used for heart failure and tachycardia unresponsive to beta blockers, is an \ninhibitor of the If or “I-funny” channel, which contributes to normal sinus node \nfunction.

Mortality benefit is greatest for \nLBBB with QRS >150 mSec.\nSummary of therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy\nThe following classes of medications lower mortality in systolic HF:\n• ACE inhibitor or ARBs; use one or the other but not both\n• Beta blockers (not all are equal; best mortality benefit is metoprolol, carvedilol, or \nbisoprolol)\n• Spironolactone (or eplerenone)\n• AICD (if EF <35%)\n• Biventricular pacemaker (if QRS >120 mSec)\nManagement of Severe Systolic CHF (Cardiogenic Shock)\nAdditional support may be needed in hospitalized patients with cardiogenic shock. Patients are \nadmitted to critical care units for support and treatment of hypotension and pulmonary \nedema. Fluid management is difficult, since increasing preload with fluids in an attempt to \nraise blood pressure may worsen pulmonary edema. In such hypotensive patients, beta \nblockers are now contraindicated, unlike outpatient CHF where they are first line.\nSympathomimetic inotropic amines (especially dobutamine ) and phosphodiesterase inhibitors \n(amrinone, milrinone) are sometimes used to raise cardiac output in the management of severe \nacute systolic HF in hospitalized patients. They must be administered by IV infusion and need \ncontinuous monitoring of the blood pressure and cardiac rhythm. Patients with ongoing \ninfarction or ischemia are challenging, in that increasing the cardiac output also increases \ncardiac work and energy consumption, thus potentially extending the myocardial infarction. \nIn extreme HF with hypotension, the above medications may fail, and the patient’s heart may \nnot be able to support circulatory function. In that case, an intra-aortic balloon pump can be \nused to improve perfusion and improve mortality. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  \n(ECMO) may be used to remove the patient’s RBCs, remove the CO2 and supply O2, then \nre-infuse into the patient. Biventricular assist  devices (previously called “artificial hearts”) \nmay be used if the patient is awaiting heart transplantation. Heart transplantation  is typically \nthe only long-term effective treatment for very severe HF.Clinical Pearl\nDiastolic HF may worsen when \ndiuretics and vasodilators are \nused excessively. The goal in \ndiastolic HF is to slow the \nheart rate with beta blockers \nand calcium channel blockers \n(verapamil, diltiazem) in order \nto allow adequate diastolic \nfilling.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   158 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

It is considered a medical emergency and requires \nhospitalization. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. There are \nnon-cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema but in this section we will discuss only cardio-\ngenic pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by an acute increase in left \nventricular pressure due to ventricular dysfunction which leads to fluid accumulation in the \npulmonary interstitium. \nSigns and Symptoms\n• Tachypnea\n• Cough with pink frothy sputum\n• Cyanosis\n• Pulmonary crackles or wheezes\nLab workup includes monitoring of blood oxygen and CO2 content; chest x-ray (prominent \npulmonary vessels, effusions, Kerley B lines); and ECG to exclude arrhythmias and ongoing MI. \nTreatment in hospitalized patients includes all CHF treatments above, but also includes \noxygen; IV loop diuretics (furosemide); morphine sulfate; nitroglycerin (reduces preload); IV \nACE inhibitors; non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation in patients with severe hypoxia or \nhypercapnia after medications; and intubation/ventilation in patients who fail all of the above.\nManagement of Diastolic HF\nPatients with diastolic HF (thick ventricles, preserved EF) do not benefit from inotropic agents, \nsince their cardiac contractility is normal. ACE inhibitors are less useful than in systolic HF. \nDiuretics must be used cautiously, since limited preload (filling) is a hallmark of their disease.\nPreferred management for HF with preserved systolic function includes the following:\n• Diuresis as needed for volume overload\n• BP control (CCBs, BBs, or ACE inhibitors/ARB)\n• Exercise program and cardiac rehabilitation\nBeta blockers are now used less often but may be added for rate control of atrial fibrillation or \nif patient has concurrent CAD.\nClinical Recall\nWhat is the best therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?\nA.

It becomes clinically symptomatic during pregnancy. Mitral \nstenosis consists of thickened mitral valve leaflets, fused commissures, and chordae tendineae. \nMost cases are secondary to rheumatic fever. Rarely, it is caused by a congenital defect, \ncalcification of the valve, or post-radiation treatment to the chest.\nPathogenesis.  Mitral valve stenosis impedes left ventricular filling. Increased left atrial \npressure is referred to the lungs, causing pulmonary congestion. Forward cardiac output \nbecomes reduced, secondary pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs, and eventually right \nventricular failure results.\nClinical Symptoms. Usually manifest slowly over years.\n• Dyspnea\n• Orthopnea\n• Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea\n• Fatigue\n• Wasting\n• Hemoptysis (due to rupture of pulmonary vessels)\n• Systemic embolism (due to stagnation of blood in an enlarged left atrium)\n• Hoarseness (due to impingement of an enlarged left atrium on the recurrent laryngeal \nnerve)\n• Right-sided heart failure: hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral edema\nPhysical Signs\n• Atrial fibrillation (irregular cardiac rhythm)\n• Pulmonary rales\n• Decreased pulse pressure\n• Loud S1\n• Opening snap following S2\n• Diastolic rumble (low-pitched apical murmur)\n• Sternal lift (due to right ventricular enlargement)\nDiagnosis is made with the following:\n• EKG : possible signs of right ventricular hypertrophy; possible left and right atrial \nabnormalities; atrial fibrillation (common)\n• Chest x-ray : large left atrium (indicated by a double-density right heart border, \nposterior displacement of esophagus, and elevated left mainstem bronchus), straight -\nening of left heart border; possible signs of pulmonary hypertension, including Kerley \nB lines and increased vascular markings; large pulmonary artery\n• Echocardiogram (best test ): thickening of mitral valve leaflets and a reduction in the \nexcursion and area of the valve leaflets; possible left atrial enlargement; trans-  \nesophageal echocardiogram often needed to visualize valve\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   160 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

Mitral commissurotomy or valve replacement is done if balloon \ndilation fails. Pulmonary hypertension is not a contraindication for surgery.\nMitral Regurgitation\nMitral regurgitation is backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium, due to \ninadequate functioning (insufficiency) of the mitral valve, most commonly from ischemia. \nMen > women.\nThe etiology of mitral regurgitation is due to abnormalities of the mitral leaflets, annulus, and \nchordae tendineae. Common causes include hypertension, CHF, ischemic heart disease, \nrheumatic fever, and any cause of dilation of the left ventricle.\nTable 5-8. Acute versus Chronic Etiologies of Mitral Valve Regurgitation\nAcute Chronic\n• Rupture chordae tendineae \n(permits prolapse of a portion of \na mitral valve leaflet into the left \natrium)\n• Papillary muscle rupture\n• Endocarditis (may lead to valvular \ndestruction)\n• Trauma• Rheumatic heart disease (causing scarring and \nretraction of valve and leaflets)\n• Papillary muscle dysfunction\n• Mitral valve prolapse (click-murmur syndrome, \nBarlow syndrome, floppy mitral valve)\n• Endocarditis\n• Calcification of the mitral valve annulus\n• Accompanying hypertrophic obstructive  \ncardiomyopathy\n• Congenital endocardial cushion defect, corrected \ntransposition\n• Endocardial fibroelastosis\n• Severe left ventricular dilatation\nPathogenesis\n• A portion of the left ventricular stroke volume is pumped backward into the left \natrium instead of forward into the aorta, resulting in increased left atrial pressure and \ndecreased forward cardiac output. Traditional measurement of the cardiac output by \nEF may be normal, since the LV empties well. It is just not all in the correct direction. \nA regurgitant fraction needs to be estimated by Doppler during echocardiography.\n• Volume overload occurs, increasing preload.\n• Afterload is decreased as the left ventricle empties part of its contents into the rela -\ntively low-pressure left atrium.\n• This helps to compensate for the regurgitation by augmenting ejection fraction.\n• Left ventricular dysfunction occurs after prolonged compensation.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   161 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

Regardless of \nthe cause, left atrial and left ventricular enlargement occurs if the condition is chronic.\n• Left-heart catheterization is the single most accurate test.\nTreatment.  Medical therapy . The goal is to relieve symptoms by increasing forward cardiac \noutput and reducing pulmonary venous hypertension. ARBs/hydralazine, arteriolar vasodila-\ntors (ACE inhibitors), digitalis, and diuretics are used.\nSurgical therapy . Mitral valve replacement is indicated when symptoms persist despite opti -\nmal medical management. \n• Indicated with significantly limiting symptoms and severe mitral regurgitation; the \nrisk of surgery rises in chronic heart failure.\n• Indicated when symptoms persist despite optimal medical management.\n• Repair is preferable to replacement.\nPatients with regurgitation but few symptoms should defer surgery, as their condition may \nremain stable for years.\nMitral Valve Prolapse\nMitral valve prolapse is the most common congenital valvular abnormality (2–3% population) \ntypically seen in young women.

Mitral valve replacement is rarely needed.\nAortic Stenosis\nAortic stenosis is most commonly caused by calcification and degeneration of a congenitally \nnormal valve. It is common in the elderly. Other etiologies include:\n• Calcification and fibrosis of a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve\n• Rheumatic valvular disease, i.e., if the aortic valve is affected by the rheumatic fever, \nthe mitral valve is also invariably affected\nAortic stenosis results in elevation of left ventricular systolic pressure, and the resultant left \nventricular hypertrophy maintains cardiac output without dilation of the ventricular cavity. \nTherefore, the stroke volume is normal until the late stages of the disease.\nForceful atrial contraction augments filling at the thick, noncompliant ventricle and generates \na prominent S4 gallop that elevates the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy and high intramyocardial wall tension account for the increased \noxygen demands and, along with decreased diastolic coronary blood flow, account for the \noccurrence of angina pectoris.\nAs the myocardium fails, mean left ventricular diastolic pressure increases, and symptoms of \npulmonary congestion ensue.\nClinical Presentation. \n• Angina, syncope, and dyspnea from CHF (classic symptoms)\n• Pulsus tardus et parvus\n• Carotid thrill\n• Systolic ejection murmur in aortic area, usually with thrill, harsh quality, radiates to \ncarotidsClinical Pearl\nLook for AS in older patients \npresenting with syncope \nrelated to exertion.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   163 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

The increased pulse pressure in \nchronic aortic regurgitation is due to the large stroke volume, causing increased systolic and \ndecreased diastolic pressure.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   165 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

It is \nassociated with heart disease but also occurs with no detectable disease. Thromboembolic \nevents occur with AF and can cause significant morbidity and mortality.\nFigure 5-14.  Atrial Fibrillation Figure 5-14. Atrial Fibrillation\nAF is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation \nwith subsequent decline of atrial function. \n• On ECG, there is replacement of consistent P waves by fibrillatory waves that vary in \nsize, shape, and timing, associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular \nresponse (irregularly, irregular).\n• The ventricular response to AF depends on electrophysiologic properties of the AV \nnode, the level of vagal and sympathetic tone, and the action of drugs.\n• Extremely rapid rates (>200 bpm) suggest the presence of an accessory pathway \n(W-P-W syndrome), which may manifest as AF. \nWhen AF is compared with atrial flutter, atrial flutter is found to be more organized than AF, \nwith a sawtooth pattern of regular atrial activation called flutter (f) waves on the ECG, \nparticularly visible in leads II, III, and aVF.\nThe diagnosis of AF should be considered in elderly patients who present with complaints of \nshortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. The arrhythmia should also be suspected in \npatients with acute fatigue or exacerbation of CHF. In some patients, AF may be identified on \nthe basis of an irregularly irregular pulse or ECG obtained for another condition.\n05_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch05.indd   179 20/05/19   4:27 PM",

The goals of initial management are hemodynamic stabilization, ventricular \nrate control, and prevention of embolic complications. When AF does not terminate sponta -\nneously, the ventricular rate should be treated to slow ventricular response and anticoagula -\ntion started. Two approaches are used in management:\n• Ventricular rate control\n• Rhythm control  (attempts to convert to and maintain sinus rhythm)\nThere is little difference in outcome between rate control and pharmacologic rhythm control; \n<25% of patients on an antiarrhythmic regimen remained in sinus rhythm at the end of 1 year.\nAs a general concept, rate control alone is considered for the patient who notices very few of \nthe symptoms of the arrhythmia, while rhythm control is applied to the patient who immedi-\nately notices the arrhythmia and is experiencing the consequences (shortness of breath, or \ndevelopment of heart failure), or who is symptomatic on rate control.\nCardioversion  (rhythm control)—mechanical cardioversion  involves an electrical shock \nsynchronized with the intrinsic activity of the heart. The synchronization ensures that elec -\ntrical stimulation does not occur during the vulnerable phase of the cardiac cycle. \n• May be performed electively to restore sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF\n• May be performed for immediate need, i.e., when arrhythmia is main factor respon -\nsible for hemodynamic instability (acute heart failure, hypotension, or angina)\n• Carries a risk of thromboembolism, so in cases of elective cardioversion, initiate \nanticoagulation before the procedure\nCardioversion (rhythm control)—pharmacologic cardioversion  can be achieved with drugs. \nIt is less effective than electrical cardioversion, but it does not require conscious sedation or \nanesthesia, as does mechanical cardioversion.\n• Carries a risk of thromboembolism, so initiate anticoagulation\n• Drugs proven effective for AF include amiodarone, dofetilide, flecainide, ibutilide, \npropafenone, and quinidine\n• Drugs used to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF include amiodarone, \ndisopyramide, dofetilide, flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol\nCatheter ablation  of AF foci is sometimes used as one of the nonpharmacologic therapies for \neradicating AF. The techniques evolved with the demonstration that most AF is initiated by \nectopic beats from focal areas that may be targeted for ablation. These foci arise more com-\nmonly from the 4 pulmonary veins. Thus, techniques have focused on the identification and \nelimination of these foci.Note\nRoutine rhythm control for AF \nis not indicated.

The initial goal is <100–110 beats/min, \nalthough slower rates are sometimes recommended for severely ill patients. Beta blockers, \ncalcium channel blockers, and digoxin are the drugs most commonly used for rate control. \nThese agents do not  convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and should not be used for that \npurpose. Beta blockers  and calcium channel blockers  are effective in reducing the heart rate \nat rest and during exercise in patients with AF. Digoxin , because of the inotropic effects, is the \ndrug of choice in patients with coexisting systolic heart failure. Factors that should guide drug \nselection include the patient’s medical condition and the presence of concomitant heart failure. \nThe following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control at rest \nand during exercise: atenolol, metoprolol, verapamil, and diltiazem.\nAnticoagulation . The rate of ischemic stroke among patients with nonrheumatic AF averages \n5% per year, which is 2–7x the rate for people without AF. Therefore, anticoagulation is \nbeneficial for many patients despite its risk of bleeding.\nThe CHADS score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in a patient with \nAF. It is used to determine whether treatment is required with anticoagulation or antiplatelet \ntherapy. A high CHADS score corresponds to a greater risk of stroke.\n• C for CHF,  H for hypertension,  A for age >75,  D for diabetes,  S for prior stroke or TIA\n• Each condition receives 1 point except prior stroke, which gets 2.\nCHADS Score Treatment\n0 • No treatment\n1 • Give aspirin or anticoagulate\n≥2 • Anticoagulate\nControl the heart rate, then anticoagulate.

Anticoagulation is continued \nindefinitely.\nPre-excitation syndrome\nWolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW)\nPre-excitation is a condition in which all or some portion of the ventricle is activated by atrial \nimpulses earlier than if the impulses were to reach the ventricles by way of the normal cardiac \nconduction pathways. This is achieved by the use of accessory pathways (Kent bundle).\n• Classically, EKG shows a short PR interval followed by a wide QRS complex with a \nslurred initial deflection, or delta wave, representing early ventricular activation.\n• WPW is associated with paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias alternating with \nventricular arrhythmias, AF, and atrial flutter.\nTreatment.  If the patient is hemodynamically unstable , then immediate synchronized \ncardioversion is indicated (synchronized cardioversion).

It is almost always caused by blood \nloss, most commonly GI or menstrual. \nIron absorption is tightly regulated. A man requires 1 mg per day and a woman 2–3 mg per \nday on average. It is difficult for the body to increase the level of iron absorption. If there is \neven a modest increase in blood loss—occult blood in the stool, heavier menstrual flow, or \nincreased demand such as in pregnancy—the body is poorly equipped to increase its level of \nabsorption to exceed 3–4 mg per day. Other etiologies are increased urinary loss of blood, mal-\nabsorption, hemolysis, and poor oral intake.\nClinical Presentation.  Mild anemia may have no or very limited symptoms. As hematocrit \napproaches 30%, fatigue and poor exercise tolerance may develop. As hematocrit lowers to \n25%, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and pallor develop. Older patients and \nthose with coronary artery disease may become dyspneic at higher levels of hematocrit. More \nsevere anemia results in lightheadedness, confusion, syncope, and chest pain. A systolic \nejection murmur (“flow” murmur) may develop in any patient with moderately severe anemia. \nThese symptoms are not specific for iron deficiency anemia and may develop with any form of \nanemia provided it is sufficiently severe.\nSym ptoms specific to iron deficiency are rare and cannot be relied upon to determine the \ndiagnosis: brittle nails, spoon-shaped nails, glossitis, and pica. Iron deficiency anemia as a \nspecific diagnosis is determined by laboratory findings, not symptoms.\nDiagnosis.  A low serum ferritin <10 ng/mL is the most characteristic finding of iron deficien-\ncy anemia. Low ferritin has good specificity (>99%) but poor sensitivity (60%); the ferritin \nlevel may be falsely elevated because it is an acute phase reactant and may be  elevated in other \ninflammatory states or with malignancy. MCV is low except in very early cases. The serum \niron is low and the total iron binding capacity is high. The RDW is elevated. The most specific \ntest, although rarely necessary, is a bone marrow biopsy looking for stainable iron stores. The \nreticulocyte count is low. Platelet levels rise.\nTreatment.  Treatment usually includes oral therapy with ferrous sulfate tablets, continued until Hb \nand Ht have normalized and an additional 2-3 months to “restore” iron stores. With replacement of \niron, a brisk increase in reticulocytes will be seen 2 weeks into treatment. Parenteral iron is used in \npatients with malabsorption, kidney disease, or an intolerance to oral therapy. Blood transfusion is \nthe most effective way to deliver iron but is  reserved for those with severe symptoms.\nAnemia of Chronic Disease\nAnemia of chronic disease is a defect in the body’s ability to make use of iron sequestered in \nstores within the reticuloendothelial system. It can be microcytic or normocytic. Anemia can \naccompany virtually any chronic inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic condition. Hepcidin, a \nregulator of iron metabolism, plays an important role in anemia of chronic disease. In states \nwhere hepcidin level is abnormally high (e.g., inflammation), serum iron falls due to iron trap -\nping within macrophages and liver cells and decreased gut iron absorption. This typically leads to \nanemia caused by an inadequate amount of serum iron being available for developing red cells.Clinical Pearl\nIn early iron deficiency, serum \niron may be normal. (Ferritin \nis low and TIBC is elevated.)\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   196 16/05/19   10:48 AM",
    "page_204": "Chapter 6   ●  Hematology\n197\n• Hepcidin inhibits iron transport by binding to the iron export channel ferroportin \nlocated on the surface of gut enterocytes and the plasma membrane of macrophages.\n• By inhibiting ferroportin, it prevents iron from being exported and the iron is seques -\ntered in the cells. It also prevents enterocytes from allowing iron into the hepatic \nportal system, thereby reducing dietary iron absorption.\n• The iron release from macrophages is also reduced by ferroportin inhibition.\n• In genetic diseases where hepcidin level is abnormally low, iron overload may occur \n(hemochromatosis) due to unwarranted ferroportin facilitated iron influx.\nClinical Presentation.  Symptoms are based on the severity of the anemia. The only other \nsymptoms are based on the specifics of the underlying disease.\nDiagnosis.  Serum ferritin level is normal or elevated. Serum iron level and total iron  binding \ncapacity (TIBC) are both low. Reticulocyte count is low.\nTreatment.  Correct the underlying disease. Iron supplementation and erythropoietin will not \nhelp, except in renal disease and anemia caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nSideroblastic Anemia\nSideroblastic anemia is a microcytic anemia caused by a disorder in the synthesis of hemoglobin, \ncharacterized by trapped iron in the mitochondria of nucleated RBCs. There are both hereditary \nand acquired forms. The hereditary form  is due to a defect in aminolevulinic acid synthase or an \nabnormality in vitamin B6 metabolism. The acquired form  is due to drugs such as chloram -\nphenicol, isoniazid, or alcohol. Lead poisoning can cause sideroblastic anemia as well. \nThere is an association with myelodysplastic syndromes and refractory anemia. Sideroblastic \nanemia may progress to acute myelogenous leukemia in a small percentage of patients. \nClinical Presentation.  Symptoms are related to the severity of the anemia. There is no specific \nfinding that will be sufficiently suggestive of sideroblastic anemia to allow a diagnosis without \nsignificant lab evaluation.\nDiagnosis.  Serum ferritin level is elevated. Transferrin saturation is very high, and thus TIBC is \nvery low. Serum iron level is high. The most specific test is a Prussian Blue stain of RBCs in the \nmarrow that will reveal the ringed sideroblasts. Marrow reticuloendothelial iron is strikingly \nincreased. Sideroblastic anemia is the only microcytic anemia in which serum iron is elevated.\nTreatment.  Remove the offending drug. Some patients, especially those with INH-associated \nsideroblastic anemia, will respond to pyridoxine therapy 2-4 mg per day. Consider transfusion \nfor serious cases and BMT for refractory cases.Clinical Pearl\nBoth iron deficiency and \nanemia of chronic disease may \nhave decreased serum iron.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   197 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

Patients become \nseverely symptomatic starting age 6 months, when the body would normally switch \nfrom fetal hemoglobin to adult hemoglobin. They are severely symptomatic with \ngrowth failure, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and bony deformities secondary to \nextramedullary hematopoiesis. They are later symptomatic from hemochromatosis, \ncirrhosis, and CHF from chronic anemia and transfusion dependence.\nDiagnosis.  Clues to the diagnosis of thalassemia trait is a mild anemia with a profound \nmicrocytosis. Beta thalassemia major has the severe symptoms, large spleen, and bone \nabnormalities described. Both forms of thalassemia are diagnosed by having a microcytic \nanemia with normal iron studies. Hemoglobin electrophoresis differentiates which type of \nthalassemia is present. In beta thalassemia, there is an increased level of hemoglobin F and \nhemoglobin A2. In beta thalassemia major, the hemoglobin is as low as 3–4 g/dL. Those with \nalpha thalassemia will have normal amounts of hemoglobins F and A2. Tetrads of beta chains \nare called hemoglobin H. Hemoglobin H is present in alpha thalassemia with 3 of 4 genes \ndeleted. Target cells are present in all forms of thalassemia trait and thalassemia major. The \nRDW is normal in all forms because all of the cells are of the same size.\nTreatment.  Thalassemia traits of both the alpha and beta types do not require specific treat -\nment. Beta thalassemia major patients require blood transfusions once or twice a month. The \nchronic transfusions lead to iron overload, which requires treatment with deferasirox. Oral \ndeferasirox is the standard of care. This is easier to give than deferoxamine, which requires a \nsubcutaneous pump. Splenectomy eliminates a major area of hemolysis and therefore helps \nreduce transfusion requirements. A small number of patients can be treated with a bone \nmarrow transplantation. \nTable 6-1.

The most common cause is pernicious  anemia, a \ndisorder causing decreased intrinsic factor production due to autoimmune destruction of \nparietal cells. The incidence of pernicious anemia increases with age. Gastrectomy and atrophic \ngastritis can also decrease intrinsic factor production. Various forms of malabsorption such as \nsprue, regional enteritis, and blind loop syndrome can block absorption of vitamin B12. \nPancreatic insufficiency can result in the inability to absorb the vitamin. Rarely, tapeworm \ninfection with Diphyllobothrium latum  can decrease absorption.  Decreased intake is unusual \nand requires several years to produce disease.\nClinical Presentation.  Manifestations vary with the severity of the anemia. As such, you cannot \nspecifically determine that a patient has B12 deficiency only from the symptoms of anemia. \nNeurologic manifestations may involve almost any level of the neurologic system. Patients may \nhave peripheral neuropathy, position sense abnormality, vibratory, psychiatric, autonomic, motor, \ncranial nerve, bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. Glossitis,  diarrhea, and abdominal pain may \noccur. Y ou may have either the hematologic or neurologic deficits individually or combined. \nDiagnosis.  Anemia with macrocytosis (increased MCV). A smaller number of patients may \nhave the neurologic deficits alone. The WBCs have hypersegmented neutrophils with a mean \nlobe count >4. The red cells are characterized by macro-ovalocytes. Although macrocytosis can \noccur with hemolysis, liver disease, and myelodysplasia, these give round  macrocytes. B12 and \nfolate deficiency produce oval macrocytes. The hematologic pattern of vitamin B12 deficiency is \nindistinguishable from folate deficiency. The reticulocyte count is reduced, although the bone \nmarrow is hypercellular. Pancytopenia may occur. An elevated LDH, bilirubin, and iron level \nmay occur and are due to mild hemolysis of immature erythrocytes. \n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   200 16/05/19   10:48 AM",
    "page_208": "Chapter 6   ●  Hematology\n201\nThe most specific test is a low B12 level. Antibodies to intrinsic factor and parietal cells \nconfirm the etiology as pernicious anemia. The Schilling test is rarely used to determine the \netiology of vitamin B12 deficiency. It is not necessary if the patient has a low B12 level com-\nbined with the presence of antibodies to intrinsic factor. An elevated methylmalonic acid level \noccurs with B12 deficiency and is useful if the B12 level is equivocal.\nTreatment.  Replace the vitamin B12 lifelong. Options available for treating clinical vitamin \nB12 deficiency include oral (daily)  and parenteral (monthly intramuscular or subcutane-\nous)  preparations. Parenteral route is recommended for patients with neurologic manifesta-\ntions of B12 deficiency. IV dosing is not recommended because that would result in most of \nthe vitamin being lost in the urine.\nResponse of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia to treatment is usually rapid, with reticulocytosis \noccurring within 2–5 days and hematocrit normalizing within weeks. Treatment with cobala-\nmin effectively halts progression of the deficiency process but might not fully reverse more \nadvanced neurologic effects . If the underlying cause of the vitamin B12 deficiency is treatable \n(e.g., fish tapeworm infection or bacterial overgrowth), then treatment should include address-\ning the underlying etiology.\nPatients who have vitamin B12 deficiency with associated megaloblastic anemia might \nexperience severe hypokalemia  and fluid overload early in treatment due to increased erythro -\npoiesis, cellular uptake of potassium, and increased blood volume. Once treated for a  vitamin \nB12 deficiency due to pernicious anemia or other irreversible problems with absorption, \npatients need to continue some form of cobalamin therapy lifelong .\nFolic acid replacement can correct the hematologic abnormalities of B12 deficiency, but not \nthe neurologic abnormalities.\nFolic Acid Deficiency\nFolic acid deficiency is almost always caused by some form of decreased dietary intake. It can lead \nto anemia. Occasionally, increased requirements from pregnancy, skin loss in diseases like eczema, \nor increased loss from dialysis and certain anticonvulsants such as phenytoin may occur. Con -\nsumption of high amounts of alcohol may have a direct effect on the folate absorption, due to \ninhibition of the enzyme intestinal conjugase. Folate is presented in foods as polyglutamate, which \nis then converted into monoglutamates by intestinal  conjugase.\nClinical Presentation.  Presentation depends entirely on the severity of the anemia.\nDiagnosis.  The hematologic presentation of folic acid deficiency is identical to B12 deficiency. \nThe diagnosis is based on a low red-blood-cell, folic-acid level.\nTreatment.  Replace folic acid, almost always orally. \nHEMOLYTIC ANEMIA\nHemolytic anemias are caused by decreased RBC survival from increased destruction of the cells. \nThe destruction may be inside the blood vessels (intravascular) or outside (extravascular), which \ngenerally means inside the spleen. Hemolytic anemia may be chronic  (sickle cell disease, paroxys -\nmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and hereditary spherocytosis) or acute  (drug-induced hemolysis, \nautoimmune hemolysis, or glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency).\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   201 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

The usual symptoms of anemia are present based on the severity of the \ndisease, not necessarily the etiology. Fatigue and weakness occur with mild disease. Dyspnea \nand later confusion occur with more severe disease. The major difference between hemolytic \nanemia and the micro- and macrocytic anemias is that hemolysis is more often the etiology \nwhen the onset is sudden. This is, of course, provided that simple blood loss has been exclud-\ned. Hemolysis is often associated with jaundice and dark urine as well. Specific findings \nassociated with each disease are described below. Fever, chills, chest pain, tachycardia, and \nbackache may occur if the intravascular hemolysis is particularly rapid. \nDiagnosis.  Patients with hemolytic anemias generally have a normal MCV , but the MCV may \nbe slightly elevated because reticulocytes are somewhat larger than older cells. The reticulocyte \ncount is elevated. The LDH and indirect bilirubin are elevated. Bilirubin levels above 4 are \nunusual with hemolysis alone. The peripheral smear may aid in the specific diagnosis, and the \nhaptoglobin may be low with intravascular hemolysis. Hemoglobin may be present in the \nurine when intravascular hemolysis is sudden and severe because free hemoglobin spills into \nthe urine. There should not be bilirubin in the urine because indirect bilirubin is bound to \nalbumin and should not filter through the glomerulus. Hemosiderin is a metabolic product of \nhemoglobin. Hemosiderin may be present in the urine if the hemolysis is severe and lasts for \nseveral days.\nTreatment.  Transfusion is needed as in all forms of anemia when the hematocrit becomes low. \nHydration is, in general, useful to help prevent toxicity to the kidney tubule from the free hemo -\nglobin. Specific therapy is discussed with each disease below. Patients with chronic hemolytic \nanemia need to be maintained on chronic folic acid therapy, as there is an increase in cell turnover.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   202 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

It is characterized by irreversibly sickled cells and recurrent painful \ncrises. \n• Autosomal recessive hereditary disease \n• Hemoglobin S is due to a substitution of a valine for glutamic acid as the sixth amino \nacid of the beta globin chain. \n• Heterozygous form (trait)  (8% of African-Americans); all those with the trait are \nasymptomatic\n• Homozygous form (disease)  (1 in 400 African-Americans) \n• A sickle cell acute painful crisis may be precipitated by hypoxia, dehydration, acidosis, \ninfection, and fever. However, the crisis may occur without the presence of these \nfactors.\n• Sickle cell crisis is usually not associated with an increase in hemolysis or drop in \nhematocrit. \n –If increased hemolysis occurs, consider another etiology such as concomitant \nglucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) or acute splenic sequestra -\ntion in a child.\n –If a sudden drop in hematocrit occurs, consider another etiology such as Parvovi -\nrus B19 infection or folate deficiency. The drop in hematocrit is from acute aplasia \n(decrease in cell production), not from hemolysis.\nClinical Presentation.  Chronic manifestations include renal concentrating defects \n (isosthenuria), hematuria, ulcerations of the skin of the legs, bilirubin gallstones, aseptic \nnecrosis of the femoral head, osteomyelitis, retinopathy, recurrent infections from Pneumococ -\ncus or Haemophilus , growth retardation, and splenomegaly followed in adulthood by autosple-\nnectomy. The acute painful crisis consists of back, rib, chest, and leg pain. Occasionally some \npatients will have very severe and life-threatening manifestations of sickling. These include the \nacute chest syndrome consisting of severe chest pain, fever, leukocytosis, hypoxia, and infil-\ntrates on the chest x-ray. The acute chest syndrome is indistinguishable from pneumonia. \nStroke and TIA may also occur. Priapism can occur from infarction of the prostatic plexus of \nveins. Blindness and even myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy may also occur. Pregnant \npatients experience increased rates of spontaneous abortion and low birth weight.\nSickle trait gives normal hematologic picture with no anemia and a normal MCV . The only \nsignificant manifestation of trait is the renal concentrating defect presenting with isosthenuria \nand microscopic hematuria . Sickle trait also increases the frequency of UTI. Those with trait \nwill rarely develop the acute pain crisis under conditions of profound hypoxia and acidosis.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   203 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

Patients with sickle cell disease typically have a mild to moderate anemia with a \nnormal MCV . The reticulocyte count should always be elevated in the 10–20% range unless \nthey have folate deficiency or Parvovirus B19 aplastic crisis. LDH and bilirubin are elevated as \nin all types of hemolytic anemias. The hemoglobin electrophoresis is the most specific test. The \nperipheral smear shows sickled cells. The sickle prep (or Sickledex) is a quick screening test \nused to diagnose evidence of sickle cell trait and cannot distinguish between trait and homozy-\ngous disease. The urinalysis usually has blood present, although it is often microscopic. The \nwhite blood cell count is often elevated in the 10,000–20,000 range, although this can also \nindicate the presence of infection.\nTreatment.  An acute sickle cell pain crisis is treated with fluids, analgesics, and oxygen. \nAntibiotics are given with infection or even to patients with fever and leukocytosis even if a \ndefinite site of infection has not been documented. Ceftriaxone is the preferred agent because it \ncovers Pneumococcus  and Haemophilus  influenza. Severe or life-threatening manifestations such \nas acute chest syndrome, CNS manifestations, priapism, and acute  cardiac manifestations are \nmanaged with red blood cell transfusions if the hematocrit is low, and exchange transfusion  if \nthe hematocrit is high. Chronic management includes folic acid replacement and vaccinations \nagainst Pneumococcus  and influenza. Hydroxyurea  is used to decrease the frequency of the \nvaso-occlusive pain crisis. Bone marrow transplantation can be curative in severe cases.\nAutoimmune, Cold Agglutinin, and Drug-Induced Hemolytic Anemia\nVarious forms of acquired hemolytic anemias can result from the production of IgG, IgM, or \nactivation of complement C3 against the red cell membrane. They are often sudden and \nidiopathic. The lysis can be intravascular or extravascular (far more common). That is because \nthe destruction of the cells most often occurs through macrophages in the spleen or by Kupffer \ncells in the liver.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   204 16/05/19   10:48 AM",
    "page_212": "Chapter 6   ●  Hematology\n205\nAutoimmune destruction is often idiopathic. Known causes of autoimmune destruction are \nfrom antibodies produced in relationship to various forms of leukemia, especially chronic \nlymphocytic leukemia, viral infections, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases like lupus, or in \nrelationship to drugs. The most common drugs are the penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfa drugs, \nquinidine, alpha-methyldopa, procainamide, rifampin, and thiazides.\nUlcerative colitis can also lead to autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Cold agglutinin disease  is \nan IgM antibody produced against the red cell in association with malignancies such as \nlymphoma or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and infections such as Mycoplasma  or \nmononucleosis. Cold agglutinin destruction occurs predominantly in the liver. Liver-  mediated \ndestruction is not affected by steroids. Up to 50% of patients do not have an  associated \nunderlying disorder.\nClinical Presentation.  Symptoms are generally related to the severity of the anemia, not the \netiology. The onset may be very sudden resulting in fever, syncope, congestive failure, and \nhemoglobinuria. Mild splenomegaly is present when the disease has been occurring long enough \nfor the time it takes for the spleen to enlarge. The drug history is often the clue with drug-induced \nvarieties. Cold agglutinin disease results in cyanosis of the ears, nose, fingers, and toes. Weakness, \npallor, jaundice, and dark urine may occur as it can in all forms of hemolysis of sufficient severity.\nDiagnosis.  Autoimmune hemolysis gives a normocytic anemia, reticulocytosis, increased \nLDH, absent or decreased haptoglobin, and increased indirect bilirubin, as can all forms of \nhemolysis. The Coombs test is the specific test that diagnoses autoimmune, cold agglutinin, \nand often even drug-induced hemolysis. Spherocytes are often present on the smear.\nCopyright 2007 Gold Standard Multimedia Inc.\nFigure 6-4.

More severe autoimmune hemolysis is treated with steroids \nfirst. Splenectomy is done for those unresponsive to steroids. Cold agglutinin disease is primar -\nily managed by avoiding the cold. Most cases of cold agglutinin disease are mild, but in those \nwho have severe disease despite conservative measures, azathioprine, cyclosporine, or cyclo -\nphosphamide can be used. Rituximab is also useful. This is an anti-CD20 antibody. Steroids and \nsplenectomy don’t work well with cold agglutinin disease because the destruction occurs in the \nliver. Y ou need to control the lymphocytes which control the production of IgM.\nHereditary Spherocytosis\nHereditary spherocytosis is a chronic mild hemolysis with spherocytes, jaundice, and spleno-\nmegaly from a defect in the red cell membrane. It is an autosomal dominant disorder where \nthe loss of spectrin in the red cell membrane causes the red cell to form as a sphere, rather than \nas a more flexible and durable biconcave disc. Hemolysis occurs because the spheres are not \nable to pass the narrow passages in the spleen.\nClinical Presentation.  A chronic disorder with mild to moderate symptoms of anemia. \nBecause the hemolysis occurs in the spleen, there is often splenomegaly and jaundice. Severe \nanemia occasionally occurs from folate deficiency or Parvovirus B19 infection such as in sickle \ncell disease. Bilirubin stones often occur, leading to cholelithiasis, often at a young age.\nDiagnosis.  A normal to slightly decreased MCV anemia with the elevated LDH; indirect \nbilirubin and reticulocyte count similar to any kind of hemolysis. Although spherocytes may be \npresent with autoimmune hemolysis, hereditary spherocytosis has a negative Coombs test. The \ncells have increased sensitivity to lysis in hypotonic solutions known as an osmotic fragility test. \nThe mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is elevated.\nTreatment.  Most patients require no treatment beyond folate replacement chronically. In \nthose with more severe anemia, removal of the spleen will eliminate the site of the hemolysis. \nThe symptoms and jaundice will resolve but the spherocytes will remain.\nCopyright 2007 Gold Standard Multimedia Inc.\nFigure 6-5.

    "page_214": "Chapter 6   ●  Hematology\n207\nParoxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a red cell membrane defect leading to \nintermittent dark urine and venous thrombosis and a chronic form of hemolysis. A red cell \nmembrane defect in phosphatidyl-inositol glycan A (PIG-A) allows increased binding of \ncomplement to the red cell, leading to increased intravascular hemolysis. It is a clonal stem-cell \ndisorder, and so can develop into aplastic anemia and leukemia. The cells are more susceptible \nto lysis by complement in an acid environment. Everyone becomes a little acidotic at night \nbecause of a relative hypoventilation.\nClinical Presentation.  In addition to symptoms of anemia, these patients characteristically \npresent with dark urine from intravascular hemolysis. Thrombosis  of major venous  structures, \nparticularly the hepatic vein (Budd-Chiari syndrome), is a common cause of death in these \npatients. The hemoglobinuria is most commonly in the first morning urine because the \nhemolysis occurs more often when patients develop a mild acidosis at night.\nDiagnosis.  Besides the usual lab findings of hemolysis, such as an increased LDH, bilirubin, \nand reticulocyte count, these patients have brisk intravascular hemolysis and therefore have a \nlow haptoglobin and hemoglobin in the urine. Hemosiderinuria occurs when the capacity of \nrenal tubular cells to absorb and metabolize the hemoglobin is overwhelmed, and the sloughed \noff iron-laden cells are found in the urine. The gold standard test is flow cytometry for CD55 \nand CD59 on white and red cells. In PNH, levels are low or absent.\nTreatment.  Treatment for PNH depends on the severity of symptoms. Some patients with few \nor no symptoms require only folic acid and possible iron supplementation. Over time, the dis -\nease may progress and thus require more aggressive care.\n• In the anemic patient with signs of hemolysis, prednisone is often given to slow the \nrate of red blood cell destruction.\n• In the patient with acute thrombosis, thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase,  urokinase, \nor tissue plasminogen activator) is often administered, followed by long-term antico -\nagulation drugs to help prevent further blood clots.\n• Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and ibuprofen may also help prevent blood clots. \nUnfortunately, some patients will continue to develop blot clots despite aggressive \nanti-coagulation agents.\n• Avoid medications that increase the risk for thrombosis, such as oral birth control pills.\nPNH is often associated with bone marrow failure. Occasionally patients will respond to \nantithymocyte globulin, but frequently they will continue to require red cell and/or platelet \ntransfusions. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been the mainstay of curative \ntherapy for PNH. Recently, the drug eculizumab (brand name Soliris) was approved by the \nFDA to treat symptoms of the disease.\nGlucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a hereditary deficiency of an \nenzyme for producing the reducing capacity necessary for neutralizing oxidant stress to the \nred cell resulting in acute hemolysis. \nVarious forms of oxidant stress result in sudden hemolysis. The most common type of  oxidant \nstress is actually from infections, not drugs. The most commonly implicated drugs are sulfa \ndrugs, primaquine, dapsone, quinidine, and nitrofurantoin.Note\nDecay accelerating factor \n(DAF) is also known as CD55 \nand CD59.

A sudden, severe, \nintravascular hemolysis can occur including jaundice, dark urine, weakness, and  tachycardia. \nThe history of recent drug ingestion is the main clue to the diagnosis. \nDiagnosis.  The usual findings of an intravascular hemolysis include high LDH, bilirubin, and \nreticulocyte count with a normal MCV , low haptoglobin, and hemoglobinuria. Heinz bodies \nare precipitated hemoglobin inclusions seen in red cells. Bite cells are seen on smear indicat -\ning the removal of the Heinz bodies. The definitive test is the G6PD level, which can be falsely \nnormal immediately after an episode of hemolysis. Hence, the level is best tested about 1 week \nafter the event.\nTreatment.  There is no specific therapy beyond hydration and transfusion if the hemolysis is \nsevere. The main therapy is to avoid oxidant stress in the future. \nClinical Recall\nWhich of the following clinical scenarios is an indication for an exchange \ntransfusion in a patient with sickle cell anemia?\nA. Acute chest syndrome with a low hematocrit\nB. Priapism with a normal hematocrit\nC. Pneumococcal sepsis with an elevated hematocrit\nD. Focal neurological deficits with an elevated hematocrit STEMI with a \nnormal hematocrit\nAnswer: D\nAPLASTIC ANEMIA\nAplastic anemia is failure of all 3 cell lines produced in the bone marrow, resulting in anemia, \nleukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (pancytopenia). The marrow is essentially empty with the \nabsence of precursor cells. Many things can cause bone marrow failure, but the most common \ncause of true aplastic anemia is not often determined. Radiation, toxins such as benzene, drugs \nsuch as NSAIDs, chloramphenicol, alcohol, and chemotherapeutic alkylating agents can all \ncause aplastic anemia. Infiltration of the marrow with infections such as tuberculosis or cancer \nsuch as lymphoma can cause pancytopenia, but that is not truly aplastic anemia. Aplastic \nanemia can also be caused by infections such as hepatitis, HIV , CMV , Epstein-Barr virus, or \nParvovirus B19 in immunocompromised patients.\nClinical Presentation.  Patients typically present with bleeding from the thrombocytopenia, \nand possibly with a combination of the findings associated with deficiencies in all 3 cell lines. \nFatigue from anemia and infections from neutropenia may also occur. The clinical presenta-\ntion may give a clue to the presence of pancytopenia but is not sufficient to determine a true \naplastic anemia by clinical manifestations alone. The absence of a classical association such as \nbenzene, radiation, or chloramphenicol would most certainly not exclude a diagnosis of \naplastic anemia. The most common single etiology is idiopathic.\nDiagnosis.  Pancytopenia on a CBC is the first test. A bone marrow biopsy confirms the diagno -\nsis when alternative etiologies for a pancytopenia are not present. In other words, the marrow is \n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   208 16/05/19   10:48 AM",
    "page_216": "Chapter 6   ●  Hematology\n209\nempty of almost all precursor cells as well as evidence of primary or metastatic cancer, infection, \nor fibrosis. The marrow is hypoplastic and fat filled with no abnormal cells seen.\nTreatment.  Treatment includes bone marrow transplant when the patient is young and healthy \nenough to withstand the procedure and there is a donor available (cure rate is 80–90% of \npatients age <50). \nWhen bone marrow transplant is not possible, try immunosuppressive agents: a combination \nof antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, and prednisone (can lead to remission in 60–70% of \npatients). It is believed that T lymphocytes are primarily causal in the bone marrow failure, so \ndrugs are used to decrease the T-cell response.\nACUTE LEUKEMIA\nAcute leukemia is the rapid onset of bone marrow failure from the derangement of the pluripotent \nstem cell, causing the relentless destruction of the normal production of the entire bone marrow. \nBlood cells lose their ability to mature and function normally. Most cases of acute leukemia arise \nwith no apparent cause, but there are several well known associations: radiation exposure, \nbenzene, chemotherapeutic agents such as melphalan and etoposide, and some retroviruses. \nGenetic disorders such as Down syndrome and Klinefelter can cause an increased incidence of \nleukemia. Myelodysplasia and sideroblastic anemia can also develop into acute leukemia.\nClinical Presentation.  Patients typically present with the effects of the leukemic blast cells \ncrowding out the normal marrow cells, leading to symptoms of bone marrow failure (even if \ntotal WBC count is elevated or normal). Fatigue from anemia is the most common presenting \ncomplaint. Bleeding from thrombocytopenia occurs. Infection from the underproduction or \nabnormal function of WBCs also occurs. \nAcute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is more common in children and acute myelogenous leukemia \n(AML) is more common in adults, but they are indistinguishable clinically. ALL is more often \nassociated with infiltration of other organs, but AML can do it as well. Enlargement of the liver, \nspleen, and lymph nodes and bone pain are common at presentation. Disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation (DIC) is associated with M3 promyelocytic  leukemia. CNS involvement resembling \nmeningitis is present at the time of initial diagnosis in about 5% of patients. CNS involvement is \nmost characteristic of M4 and M5 monocytic leukemia. Rarely, a syndrome of “leukostasis” can \noccur when the white cell count is extremely elevated. This results from sludging of the leukemic \ncell in the vasculature, resulting in headache, dyspnea, confusion, and brain hemorrhage.\nDiagnosis.  The CBC is the first clue to the diagnosis. Most commonly, WBC is elevated, along \nwith thrombocytopenia and anemia. In about 10% of acute leukemias, depression of all 3 cell \nlines is evident (aleukemic leukemia). Many other disorders can present as pancytopenia \nsimilar to leukemia such as aplastic anemia, infections involving the marrow,  metastatic cancer \ninvolving the marrow, vitamin B12 deficiency, SLE, hypersplenism, and myelofibrosis. None of \nthese will have leukemic blasts circulating in the peripheral blood, however. A bone marrow \nbiopsy showing >20% blasts confirms the diagnosis of acute  leukemia. The presence of blasts \ntells you the patient has acute leukemia, but blast analysis cannot be relied upon to always tell \nwhich type is present. AML is characterized by the presence of Auer rods, myeloperoxidase, \nand esterase. ALL is characterized by the presence of the common ALL antigen (CALLA) and \nterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Auer rods are most specific for M3. Ultimately, \nthe diagnosis rests upon the use of monoclonal antibodies, which recognize specific types of \nleukemia as well as the expression of specific CD antigens on the surfaces of the cells. Nonspe-\ncific findings that are also present are hyperuricemia and an increased level of LDH.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   209 16/05/19   10:48 AM",
    "page_217": "210\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nTreatment.  Chemotherapy is used initially in all patients to induce a remission. Inducing a \nremission means a removal of over 99.9% of the leukemic cells in the body and the elimination of \nperipheral blasts in circulation. This is followed by further rounds of chemotherapy to “consoli -\ndate” the leukemia further. After chemotherapy, adults with AML or ALL should be referred for \nallogeneic  bone marrow transplantation. The initial chemotherapy for AML is cytosine arabino -\nside (AraC) and either daunorubicin or idarubicin. The initial  chemotherapy for ALL is dauno -\nrubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Promyelocytic leukemia is managed with the addition of the \nvitamin A derivative all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) . Leukostasis events are managed with \nleukapheresis in addition to the chemotherapy.\nALL patients must also undergo prophylaxis of the central nervous system to prevent relapse \nthere. The best agent for this is intrathecal methotrexate.\nCHRONIC LEUKEMIA\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized \nby the massive overproduction of myeloid cells. The cells retain most of their function until later \nin the course of the disease. Although the Philadelphia chromosome is  characteristic of the \ndisease, the cause of the production of this chromosome is unknown. It is a clonal disorder of \nmyelocytes. The Philadelphia chromosome is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, \nresulting in a gene producing an enzyme with tyrosine kinase activity.  \nFive percent of cases are Philadelphia-chromosome-negative.\nClinical Presentation.  A markedly elevated white blood cell count can be found on routine \nblood count. The most common symptoms are fatigue, night sweats, and low-grade fever. \nAbdominal pain from massive enlargement of the spleen is common. Bone pain from infiltra-\ntion with white cells can occur. Enlarged lymph nodes are rare. Infection and bleeding are \nuncommon because these white cells retain the majority of their function. Rarely, a leukostasis \nreaction can occur from extremely elevated amounts of white cells being  produced in the \nrange of 200,000–500,000/mm3. \nThe white cells then clog up the vasculature, resulting in dyspnea, blurry vision, priapism, \nthrombosis, and stroke.\nDiagnosis.  The main feature of the disease is an elevated white blood cell count consisting \npredominantly of neutrophils with a left shift. Blasts are either absent or present in very small \namounts (<5%). The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score (LAP) is diminished.  Basophilia is \ncharacteristic of CML and all myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera. \nAlthough the B12 level is often elevated, this would not be enough to establish the diagnosis. \nThe Philadelphia chromosome is a far more specific test for CML and should be done in a \npatient with a markedly elevated white cell count. A low LAP score is not as important as the \nPCR for Bcr/Abl. The platelet count can also be markedly elevated.\nTreatment.  The best initial therapy for CML is imatinib, which is also known by the manu -\nfacturer’s name, Gleevec®. Imatinib is a direct inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase produced by the \nPhiladelphia chromosome. There is nearly a 90% hematologic response to imatinib, and as \nmany as 60 to 70% of patients may lose the Philadelphia chromosome. The milder the disease, \nthe greater the degree of hematologic response. Bone marrow transplantation is no longer the Note\nCML can be confused with a \nleukemoid reaction. They are \ndistinguishable based upon \nthe leukocyte alkaline \nphosphatase score.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   210 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

This is because of the extraordinary response to \nimatinib, as well as the high mortality associated with the bone marrow transplantation itself. \nIf imatinib fails, then the therapy is bone marrow transplantation.\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a massive overproduction of mature—but still  leukemic—\nlymphocytes, usually from the monoclonal production of B lymphocytes.  Etiology is unknown.\nClinical Presentation.  CLL can often present as an asymptomatic elevation of white cells \nfound on routine evaluation of patients or during investigations for other problems. Patients \nare exclusively older with 90% being age >50. When patients do have symptoms, they are \noften nonspecific—fatigue, lethargy, and uncomfortable enlargement of lymph nodes. \nInfiltration of other parts of the reticuloendothelial system such as the spleen, liver, and bone \nmarrow also occurs. Infection and bleeding are unusual presentations of the disease. Staging \nfor CLL is as follows:\nStage 0:  lymphocytosis alone\nStage 1:  lymphadenopathy\nStage 2:  splenomegaly\nStage 3:  anemia\nStage 4:  thrombocytopenia\nStaging is important because the survival of untreated stage 0 and stage 1 disease is 10–12 \nyears even without treatment. The survival of stage 3 and stage 4 disease is 1–2 years. CLL can \nbe associated with various autoimmune phenomena such as thrombocytopenia and autoim-\nmune hemolytic anemia.\nDiagnosis.  CLL is strongly suspected when an older patient has a marked elevation in the white \ncell count with a marked lymphocytic predominance in the range of 80–98% lymphocytes. The \nmarrow is often infiltrated with the leukemic lymphocytes. CD19 is an antigen strongly \nassociated with CLL. The cell count is usually elevated in the range of 30,000–50,000, but may \ngo as high as 150,000. “Smudge cells” seen on a smear are characteristic of CLL. \nTreatment.  Early stage CLL with only an elevated white cell count or enlargement of lymph \nnodes is not treated. However, patients with symptomatic disease always need to be treated. \nThose with more advanced-stage disease should receive initial therapy with fludarabine. \nFludarabine has greater efficacy than chlorambucil and should be considered the drug of choice. \nAutoimmune hemolysis and thrombocytopenia are treated with prednisone. Rituximab is used \nin those patients who express CD20, especially with autoimmune ITP or hemolytic anemias.\nHairy cell leukemia (HCL),  a subtype of CLL, makes up 2% of all leukemias. It is character -\nized by an accumulation of abnormal B lymphocytes. The malignant B lymphocytes (“hairy \ncells” ) accumulate in the bone marrow, interfering with the production of normal cells com -\nmonly causing pancytopenia. Patients develop infections, anemia and fatigue, or easy bleed -\ning. Early satiety may occur from massive splenomegaly. \n• HCL is commonly considered in the differential diagnosis after routine blood count \nshows unexpectedly low numbers of cell lines or after unexplained bruising or \nrecurrent infections in an otherwise apparently healthy patient.\n• Bone marrow biopsy is necessary for final diagnosis: the biopsy is used to confirm \nboth the presence of HCL and the absence of any additional diseases.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   211 16/05/19   10:48 AM",
    "page_219": "212\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\n• Diagnosis can be confirmed by viewing the cells with a special stain known as TRAP \n(tartrate resistant acid phosphatase). \n• Pancytopenia in HCL is caused primarily by marrow failure and splenomegaly. Bone \nmarrow failure is caused by the accumulation of hairy cells and reticulin fibrosis in the \nbone marrow, as well as by the unfavorable effects of dysregulated cytokine production. \n• For treatment, purine analogs cladribine (2CDA) and pentostatin are the most \ncommon first-line therapies. For cladribine-resistant disease, consider monoclonal \nantibodies (rituximab most common) which destroy the malignant B cells. Alpha \ninterferon is helpful in 60% of patients to stabilize the disease or produce a slow, \nminor improvement. More than 95% of new patients are treated well or at least \nadequately by cladribine or pentostatin; most can expect a disease-free remission time \nspan of 10 years or even longer after taking one of these drugs just once.\nMyelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)\nMDS is an idiopathic disorder that is considered “pre-leukemic, ” in that a number of people go \non to develop acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). MDS is probably from a genetic defect. \nThe most common defect is 5q deletion or “5q–. ” Patients are usually elderly and present with \na pancytopenia, elevated MCV , fatigue, infections, and/or bleeding because of the low cell \ncounts. There is a small number of blasts from 1–20% and, in fact, it is the percentage of blasts \npresent that tells how “close” a person is to AML.\nMost patients die of infection or bleeding before they develop AML. This is because the \ndisorder is slowly progressive and older patients “wear out” so to speak from cytopenias, more \noften than not going into the “blast phase” that characterizes AML. By definition, you must \nexclude B12 and folate deficiency because the disorder is so similar.\nCBC and bone marrow are indispensable. Y ou may find a bi-lobed neutrophil called a \n Pelger-Huet cell which is characteristic. Genetic testing for the 5q– is essential. \nTreatment is periodic transfusions and control of the infections as they arise. Disease-  specific \ntherapy consists of the TNF inhibitor lenalidomide or thalidomide. Azacitidine or decitabine is \nuseful when the 5q- is present. Some patients who are young enough with a match can \nundergo bone marrow transplantation.\nPolycythemia Vera\nPolycythemia vera is a disorder of red cell production. Red cells are produced in excessive \namounts in the absence of hypoxia or increased erythropoietin levels.\nClinical Presentation.  Patients present with:\n• Markedly elevated hematocrit\n• Splenomegaly\n• Sometimes elevation of the platelet and white cell counts\n• Thrombosis\n• “Plethora” or redness and fullness of the face\n• Pruritis (approximately 40% of patients), particularly after exposure to warm water \nsuch as in a shower or bath; possibly caused by abnormal histamine or prostaglandin \nproduction\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   212 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

The disease is characterized by various systemic manifestations such as \nbone, kidney, and infectious complications. Etiology is unknown.\nClinical Presentation.  Bone pain is the most common clinical manifestation, usually in the \nback and the ribs, secondary to pathologic fractures. Radiculopathy from the compression of \nspinal nerve roots is also common. Infection particularly with encapsulated organisms such as \nPneumococcus  and Haemophilus  is common. Renal failure and anemia are common. The \nsymptoms of hypercalcemia such as polyuria, polydipsia, and altered mental status may occur. \nWeakness, fatigue, and pallor are common. Rarely, symptoms of a hyperviscosity syndrome \nsuch as blurry vision, confusion, and mucosal bleeding may occur.\nDiagnosis.  Although a normochromic, normocytic anemia is the most common laboratory \nfinding, this is not specific for myeloma. A protein electrophoresis with a markedly elevated \nmonoclonal immunoglobulin spike is present in almost all cases. This is most commonly IgG \nbut may be IgA, IgD, or rarely a combination of two of these.

Most \ncommonly involved are the vertebrae, ribs, pelvic bones, and bones of the thigh and upper arm. \nIf multiple myeloma is suspected with normal x-ray, consider MRI, CT, or PET. Serum B2 \nmicroglobulin is elevated in 75% of patients. Hypercalcemia from the destruction of bone is \ncommon, as is an elevation in the BUN and creatinine from the damage to the kidney from the \nimmunoglobulins, Bence-Jones protein, calcium, and hyperuricemia. A bone marrow biopsy \nwith >10% plasma cells confirms a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Bence-Jones protein is often \nnot detected by a standard protein test on a urinalysis, which mainly is meant to detect albumin. \nA specific test for Bence-Jones protein involving acidification of the urine is required. Increased \ngamma globulin levels will increase the total protein and decrease the albumin level.\nTreatment.  Y ounger patients (age <70) should be treated with autologous bone marrow \ntransplantation  in an attempt to cure the disease. Older patients should receive a combination of \nmelphalan and prednisone. Patients who are candidates for transplants should receive thalido -\nmide (or lenalidomide) and dexamethasone. Patients who are not candidates for transplants \nshould receive melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide. Hypercalcemia is treated initially with \nhydration and loop diuretics and then with bisphosphonates such as pamidronate.\nBortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor useful for relapsed myeloma or in combination with the \nother medications. It can be combined with steroids, melphalan, or lenalidomide  (thalidomide).\nMonoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain Significance (MGUS)\nDefinition.  The overproduction of a particular immunoglobulin by plasma cells without the \nsystemic manifestations of myeloma such as bone lesions, renal failure, anemia, and hypercalcemia.\nEtiology.  The cause of MGUS is unknown. MGUS is a very common abnormality present in \n1% of all patients age >50 and in 3% of those age >70. Some patients with MGUS may progress \nto multiple myeloma.\nClinical Presentation.  Patients with MGUS have no symptoms. It is found on routine blood \ntesting for other reasons. \nDiagnosis.  An elevated monoclonal immunoglobulin spike of serum protein electrophoresis \n(SPEP) in amounts lower than found in myeloma. The creatinine, calcium, and hemoglobin \nlevels are normal. An elevated total serum protein is the clue to the diagnosis. There are no \nlytic bone lesions, and the bone marrow has <5% plasma cells. The beta-2 microglobulin level \nwill be normal in most patients.\nTreatment.

Although there is a clear increase in Hodgkin disease among relatives of those with \nthe disease, there are no clear environmental or infectious etiologies for the disorder. \nHodgkin disease has bimodal age distribution—one peak in the 20s and 60s.\nClinical Presentation.  Enlarged, painless, rubbery, nonerythematous, nontender lymph nodes \nare the hallmark of the disease. Patients may also develop what are labeled “B” symptoms, \nwhich are drenching night sweats, 10% weight loss, and fevers. Although pruritus is common \nin the disease, it is not one of the “B” symptoms. Cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary \nlymphadenopathy are the most common initial signs of disease. Lymphadenopathy may \ndevelop anywhere in the body, however. Extralymphatic sites such as splenic involvement, \nskin, gastric, lung, CNS, or any other organ may possibly be involved. Extralymphatic involve-\nment is more common with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nStaging is as follows:\nStage 1:  1 lymphatic group or single extra lymphatic site\nStage 2:  2 lymphatic groups or extra lymphatic sites on same side of the diaphragm\nStage 3:   Involvement of lymphatic groups on both sides of the diaphragm or involve -\nment of any extralymphatic organ contiguous to the primary nodal site\nStage 4:   Widespread disease with involvement of diffuse extralymphatic sites such as \nbone marrow or liver\nThe staging  is the same for both Hodgkin as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In Hodgkin \nlymphoma, staging is the single most important predictor of outcomes.\nDiagnosis.  An excisional lymph node biopsy is the essential first step in determining the diagno -\nsis. After the initial diagnosis is determined by the biopsy, the most important step is to determine \nthe extent of disease because the stage will determine the nature of the therapy, i.e., radiation \nversus chemotherapy. Chest x-ray or chest CT, abdominal CT, or MRI is used to determine if the \ndisease is localized to the supraclavicular area. Lymphangiography and laparotomy are no longer \nroutinely used for staging. CT scan is sensitive enough to detect any involved lymph nodes. A \nbone marrow biopsy is used to definitively determine if the disease is truly localized.Note\nAdverse Prognostic Factors\n•  Large mediastinal \nlymphadenopathy\n• Age >40\n• “B” symptoms\n• ↑ ESR\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   215 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

PET scan can also \nbe used for that purpose.\nOther labs tests that are often abnormal, but don’t directly alter the stage of the disease, include \na CBC looking for anemia as well as increased white cell or platelet count.  Eosinophilia is \ncommon. An elevated LDH level indicates an adverse prognosis. The ESR is useful prognosti -\ncally. Elevated liver function tests help determine the need for liver biopsy.\nTreatment.  Therapy is entirely based on the stage of the disease. Localized disease such as stage \nIA and IIA is managed predominantly with radiation. In the early stages (IA, IIA), adjunct \nchemotherapy may be used with radiation. All patients with evidence of “B” symptoms as well as \nstage III or stage IV disease are managed with chemotherapy. The most effective combination \nchemotherapeutic regimen for Hodgkin disease is ABVD  (adriamycin [doxorubicin], bleomycin, \nvinblastine, and dacarbazine). ABVD is superior to MOPP (mechlorethamine, [vincristine], \nprednisone, and procarbazine) because ABVD has fewer adverse effects such as permanent \n sterility, secondary cancer formation, leukemia, aplastic anemia, and peripheral neuropathy.\nHodgkin disease has several histologic subtypes. Lymphocyte-predominant has the best \nprognosis, and lymphocyte-depleted has the worst prognosis. The histologic subtype does not \nalter anything described. The lab tests, staging, and treatments are the same.\nNon-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)\nDefinition.  The neoplastic transformation of both the B and T cell lineages of lymphatic cells. \nNHL causes the accumulation of neoplastic cells in both the lymph nodes as well as more often \ndiffusely in extralymphatic organs and the bloodstream. The Reed-Sternberg cell is absent.\nEtiology.  There are a number of infectious and autoimmune disorders associated with the develop -\nment of NHL. Their absence, however, by no means excludes the presence of NHL. Infections such \nas HIV , hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr, HTLV-I, and Helicobacter pylori  predispose to the development of \nNHL. HIV and Epstein-Barr are both more often associated with Burkitt lymphoma. HIV can also \nbe associated with immunoblastic lymphoma. The main point of knowing this is that they are both \nhigh-grade lymphomas with an aggressive progression of disease.\nClinical Presentation.  Enlarged, painless, rubbery, nonerythematous, nontender lymph nodes are \nthe hallmark of the disease. Patients may also develop what are labeled “B” symptoms, which are \ndrenching night sweats, 10% weight loss, and fevers. Although pruritus is common in the disease, \nit is not one of the “B” symptoms. In this sense, NHL is the same as Hodgkin disease. The differ -\nence is that Hodgkin disease is localized to cervical and supraclavicular nodes 80–90% of the time, \nwhereas NHL is localized only 10–20% of the time. NHL is far more likely to involve extralym -\nphatic sites as well as to have blood involvement similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CNS \ninvolvement is also more common with NHL. HIV-positive patients often have CNS involvement.\nThe staging system for NHL is the same as that for Hodgkin disease as described.\nDiagnosis.  The diagnosis of NHL rests initially on an excisional lymph node biopsy. After this, \nthe most important step is to determine the stage of the disease to determine therapy. Although \nthis is quite similar to that described for Hodgkin disease, there are several significant differ -\nences because NHL is far more likely to be widespread at initial presentation. Lymphangiogra -\nphy is never necessary, and staging laparotomy is rarely needed. The bone marrow biopsy is \nmore central as an initial staging tool. Because the presence of marrow involvement means the \npatient has Stage IV disease and therefore needs combination chemotherapy, further invasive \ntesting such as the laparotomy is not necessary. As with Hodgkin disease anemia, leukopenia, \neosinophilia, high LDH, and high ESR often accompany the disease. PET scanning is highly \nsensitive and specific for nodal and extranodal sites but not for bone marrow disease.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   216 16/05/19   10:48 AM",
    "page_224": "Chapter 6   ●  Hematology\n217\nTreatment.  As with Hodgkin disease, local disease such as stage IA and stage IIA are treated \npredominantly with radiation, and all those with “B” symptoms as well as stages III and IV \nreceive combination chemotherapy. Given the frequency of more widespread disease with \nNHL, however, this means few NHL patients are treated with radiation alone. The initial \nchemotherapeutic regimen for NHL is still CHOP (cyclophosphamide,  hydroxy-adriamycin, \nvincristine, prednisone). More elaborate chemotherapeutic regimens for NHL, of which there \nare many, are beyond the scope of what is necessary to know for the Step 2 exam.\nCNS lymphoma is often treated with radiation, possibly in addition to CHOP . Relapses of NHL \ncan be controlled with autologous bone marrow transplantation. Some patients with NHL \nexpress CD20 antigen in greater amounts. When this occurs, monoclonal antibody rituximab \nshould be used. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 antibody that has limited toxicity and adds survival \nbenefit to the use of CHOP . Thus, R-CHOP would then become first-line therapy. Prior to \nusing R-CHOP , always test completely for hepatitis B and C, as rituximab can cause fulminant \nliver injury in those with active hepatitis B or C disease.\nTumor lysis syndrome\nTumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency caused by massive tumor cell lysis, \nwith the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid into the systemic \ncirculation. Uric acid excretion can result in the precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules; \nit can also induce renal vasoconstriction, reduced renal blood flow, and inflammation, \nresulting in acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate  deposition in the \nrenal tubules can also cause acute kidney injury.\nTLS most often occurs after the initiation of cytotoxic therapy in patients with high-grade \nlymphoma (particularly Burkitt’s and acute lymphoblastic leukemia), though it can occur \nspontaneously and with other tumor types having a high proliferative rate or large tumor burden.\nPatients about to receive chemotherapy for a cancer with a high cell turnover  rate—  especially \nlymphomas and leukemias—should receive prophylactic oral or IV allopurinol plus  adequate \nIV hydration to maintain high urine output (>2.5 L/day). Rasburicase may be used as an \nalternative to allopurinol and is reserved for those at high-risk for developing TLS. Alkaliza-\ntion of the urine as a treatment of TLS is controversial.\nClinical Recall\nA 25-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of enlarged, rubbery, \nnon-erythematous, painless, non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy.

The idiopathic production of an antibody to the platelet, leading to removal of \nplatelets from the peripheral circulation by phagocytosis by macrophages. The platelets are \nbound by the macrophage and brought to the spleen, leading to low platelet counts. ITP is \noften associated with lymphoma, CLL, HIV , and connective tissue diseases.\nClinical Presentation.  Like all platelet disorders, the patient presents initially with signs of \nbleeding from superficial areas of the body such as the skin, nasal and oral mucosa, GI tract, \nurine, and vagina. The patient is generally young, more often female, and complains of \n epistaxis, bruising, hematuria, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and sometimes GI bleeding. \nPetechiae, purpura, and ecchymoses are often found on exam. The patient is generally \n otherwise healthy. Splenomegaly should be absent.\nDiagnosis.  Thrombocytopenia is the major finding. A normal spleen on exam and on imaging \nstudies such as an U/S is characteristic. Antiplatelet antibodies have a high  sensitivity but poor \nspecificity. The bone marrow should be filled with megakaryocytes indicating that there is a \nproblem with platelet destruction and not platelet production. The bone marrow will also \nexclude other causes of thrombocytopenia such as primary or  metastatic cancer, infiltration by \ninfections such as tuberculosis or fungi, or decreased  production problems such as drug, \nradiation, or chemotherapy effect on the bone marrow. The peripheral smear and creatinine \nshould be normal, excluding other platelet destruction problems such as hemolytic uremic \nsyndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. \nTreatment.  Prednisone is the initial therapy in almost all patients. Splenectomy is used in \npatients in whom very low platelet counts <10,000–20,000/mm3 continue to recur despite \nrepeated courses of steroids. IVIG or RhoGAMTM may be used in patients with profoundly low \nplatelet counts (<10,000 µL) or in patients at risk for life-threatening bleeding. Note that \nRhoGAM may only be used in Rh-positive patients. In those who recur after splenectomy, we \nuse thrombopoietin agents romiplostim or eltrombopag. Rituximab has also been used.\nVon Willebrand Disease (vWD)\nA 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with epistaxis and heavy \nperiods. She has a PT of 11 seconds (normal), a PTT of 40 seconds (prolonged), and \n217,000/mm3 platelets.\nDefinition.  An increased predisposition to platelet-type bleeding from decreased amounts of \nvon Willebrand factor.\nEtiology.  An autosomal dominant disorder resulting in a decreased amount of von  Willebrand \nfactor. This is the most common congenital disorder of hemostasis. vWD results in a decreased \nability of platelets to adhere  to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. This is different from \nplatelets aggregating with each other, which is mediated by fibrinogen. In vWD, aggregation is \nnormal, whereas adherence is abnormal. It is not necessary to know the difference between the \ndifferent subtypes of vWD for the Step 2 exam.Clinical Pearl\nPlatelet disorders can broadly \nbe classified into 2 groups:\n•  Quantitative (low platelet \ncount, eg, ITP)\n•  Qualitative (normal platelet \ncount but abnormal platelet \nfunction, eg, von \nWillebrand, Bernard \nSoulier)\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   218 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

This is mucosal and skin bleeding such as epistaxis, petechiae, bruising, and menstrual \nabnormalities. Both platelet problems as well as clotting factor abnormalities can result in GI and \nurinary tract bleeding. There is often a marked increase in bleeding after the use of aspirin.\nDiagnosis.  The platelet count and appearance are normal. The bleeding time is increased \nparticularly after the use of aspirin. The level of von Willebrand factor, also known as factor VIII \nantigen, is low. The ristocetin platelet aggregation test, which examines the ability of platelets to \nbind to an artificial endothelial surface (ristocetin), is abnormal. The PTT may be elevated in \nsome patients because of a concomitant decrease in levels of factor VIII coagulant portion.\nTreatment.  Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) is used for mild bleeding or when the patient must \nundergo minor surgical procedures. It releases subendothelial stores of von  Willebrand factor. \nFactor VIII replacement is used if desmopressin is not effective and the bleeding continues. \nFactor VIII replacement contains von Willebrand factor.

The deficiency of factor VIII in hemophilia A and factor IX in hemophilia B \nresulting in an increased risk of bleeding.\nEtiology.  Both hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders resulting in disease in \nmales. Females are carriers of the disease. Females do not express the disease because they \nwould have to be homozygous, which is a condition resulting in intrauterine death of the fetus. \nHemophilia A is far more common than B.\nClinical Presentation.  Mild deficiencies (25% or greater activity) result in either the absence of \nsymptoms or with symptoms only during surgical procedures or with trauma. More severe \ndeficiency (<5–10% activity) can result in spontaneous bleeding. Factor-type bleeding is gener -\nally deeper than that produced with platelet disorders. Examples of the type of bleeding found \nwith factor deficiencies are hemarthrosis, hematoma, GI bleeding, or urinary bleeding. Bruising \nand central nervous system bleeding can also occur. Severe hemophilia is obvious in most \npatients by the age of 2. The disorder becomes apparent often at the time of circumcision. \nDiagnosis.  A prolonged PTT with a normal PT is expected. A factor deficiency is strongly \nsuspected when a 50:50 mixture of the patient’s blood is created with a normal control and the \nPTT drops to normal. This is known as a “mixing study. ” If the PTT does not correct with mixing, \nthen an antibody inhibitor of the factor is suspected. The mixing study will only tell you that a \ndeficiency is present; it will not tell you which specific factor is deficient. Specific factor VIII or IX \nlevels are necessary to determine a precise diagnosis. This is true of both hemophilia A and B.\nTreatment.  Mild hemophilia can be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Desmopressin can \nalso be used prior to surgical procedures in mild hemophiliacs. Desmopressin works by \nreleasing subendothelial stores of factor VIII. More severe deficiencies are treated with \nreplacement of the specific factor. Desmopressin does not work for hemophilia B.\nTable 6-3.

Vitamin K deficiency can be produced by dietary deficiency, malabsorption, and the \nuse of antibiotics that kill the bacteria in the colon that produce vitamin K. The antibiotics \nmost commonly associated are broad-spectrum drugs such as fluoroquinolones, cephalospo-\nrins, and other penicillin derivatives.\nClinical Presentation.  Bleeding may mimic that of hemophilia and may occur at any site. \nLook for oozing at venipuncture sites.\nDiagnosis.  Both the PT and PTT are elevated. The PT usually elevates first and more severely. \nA correction of the PT and PTT in response to giving vitamin K is the most common method \nof confirming the diagnosis.\nTreatment.  Severe bleeding is treated with infusions of fresh frozen plasma. Vitamin K is given \nat the same time to correct the underlying production defect.\nLiver Disease\nDefinition.  Coagulopathy from the decreased production of clotting factors by the liver.\nEtiology.  Any severe liver disease or cirrhosis leads to a decreased production of the majority \nof clotting factors that are generally all made in the liver, except for factor VIII and von \nWillebrand factor. Factor VII is first factor to be depleted.\nClinical Presentation.  Bleeding may occur at any site, but the GI tract is the most common site.\nDiagnosis.  Patients have an elevation of both the PT and PTT, but the PT elevates first and is \noften more severely affected. The disorder is clinically indistinguishable from vitamin K \ndeficiency except that there is no improvement when vitamin K is given. A clear history of \nliver disease is often present, suggesting the diagnosis. Low platelet counts are often present \nfrom the hypersplenism that accompanies the liver disease.\nTreatment.  Fresh frozen plasma is used acutely to correct severe bleeding such as melena. \nLong-term management is based on the nature of the liver disease.\nDisseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)\nDefinition.  Consumptive coagulopathy from major underlying illness resulting in consump-\ntion of both platelet and clotting factor type and occasionally thrombosis. The bleeding is \nassociated with a marked production of fibrin degradation products such as d-dimers.\nEtiology.  Although essentially an idiopathic disorder, there is almost always a major underlying \ndisease in the case history. Look for evidence of sepsis most commonly. Almost any disorder \nthat results is cellular destruction and the release of tissue factor can initiate the cascade of \nconsumption of platelets as well as clotting factors. These problems include  rhabdomyolysis, \nadenocarcinomas, heatstroke, hemolysis from transfusion reactions, burns, head trauma, \nobstetrical disasters such as abruptio placenta and amniotic fluid embolism, as well as trauma, \npancreatitis, and snakebites. Promyelocytic leukemia (M3) is a classic association.\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   221 16/05/19   10:48 AM",
    "page_229": "222\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nGram-negative sepsis causes DIC by the releasing endotoxin. In acute promyelocytic leuke -\nmia (M3), the destruction of leukemic granulocyte precursors results in the release of large \namounts of proteolytic enzymes from their storage granules, causing microvascular damage. \nOther malignancies may also cause DIC by augmenting the expression of various oncogenes \nthat result in the release of tissue factor. DIC exists in acute and chronic forms.\n• Acute DIC  develops when sudden exposure of blood to procoagulants (tissue factor, \ntissue thromboplastin) generates intravascular coagulation. The compensatory \nhemostatic mechanisms are quickly overwhelmed, and, as a consequence, a severe \nconsumptive coagulopathy leading to hemorrhage develops.\n• In contrast, chronic DIC  reflects a compensated state that develops when blood is \ncontinuously or intermittently exposed to small amounts of tissue factor. Compensa -\ntory mechanisms are not overwhelmed. Chronic DIC is more frequently observed in \npatients with solid tumors and in those with large aortic aneurysms.\nClinical Presentation.  Bleeding from any site in the body is possible because of a decrease in \nboth the platelet as well as clotting factor levels. Thrombosis is less common. Hemolysis is \noften present and may lead to acute renal failure, jaundice, and confusion.\nDiagnosis.  DIC is suspected when a patient has a serious underlying disorder as described \nwith bleeding and there is elevation in both the PT and PTT with a decrease in the platelet \ncount. The fibrinogen level is often low because it has been consumed. D-dimers and fibrin-\nsplit products are present in increased amounts, suggesting the consumption of all available \nelements of the coagulation system. The peripheral blood smear often shows the schistocytes \nas fragmented cells consistent with intravascular hemolysis.\nTreatment.  Because most patients present with severe bleeding, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and \nsometimes platelet transfusions are necessary to correct the bleeding. Heparin is controversial \nand is rarely used except in those patients presenting predominantly with thrombosis. Don’t \nforget to correct the underlying disorder.\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are \ntwo varieties of the same disease process with considerable overlap. There is no specific diag -\nnostic test, so the diagnosis is based on the clinical triad (HUS) or pentad (TTP).\n• Most cases of TTP are idiopathic and arise from inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13, \nwhich is responsible for cleaving large multimers of von Willebrand factor into smaller \nunits. The increase in circulating multimers of vWF increase platelet adhesion to areas of \nendothelial injury, particularly the arteriole-capillary junctions.\n• Some cases of TTP are associated with specific diseases (cancer, HIV) and drugs (ticlopi -\ndine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine, and interferon) and are referred to as secondary TTP. \nADAMTS13 activity is generally not as depressed in secondary TTP.\nHUS predominantly affects children. Most cases are caused by a shiga-like toxin produced by E. coli  \nO157:H7 although Campylobacter , Shigella , and some viruses have also been implicated. It is one of \nthe most common causes of acute renal failure in childhood and  carries up to 10% mortality.\nHUS consists of a triad of hemolytic anemia, uremia, and thrombocytopenia. TTP has the same \n3 findings, and is also associated with fever and neurologic problems. Y ou do not have to have \nall 5 findings simultaneously to be considered to have TTP .

For that reason, the disorder is sometimes called  \nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis  (HITT ).  Thrombosis develops in \napproximately 20% of patients with HIT, with mortality as high as 30%.\nDiagnosis of HIT is based on the combined clinical findings, thrombocytopenia characteris-\ntics, and lab studies of HIT antibodies (positive in ~85% of patients with type 2 HIT). Treat-\nment begins with discontinuation of all heparin products (including heparin flushes of \nintravenous catheters), and later the administration of an alternative anticoagulant such as \nargatroban or lepirudin. Patients diagnosed with HIT should avoid all forms of heparin for life.\nWarfarin\nWarfarin (Coumadin)  is the most widely prescribed anticoagulant for the prevention and \ntreatment of thromboembolic disease. It was initially introduced as a pesticide against rodents, \nand long-acting forms of warfarin are still used for this purpose.\nWarfarin anticoagulates by inhibiting an enzyme that recycles oxidized vitamin K to its \nreduced form. Warfarin does not antagonize the action of vitamin K, but rather antagonizes \nvitamin K recycling. Once vitamin K is reduced, the vitamin K dependent factors (factors \n2,7,9,10) are eventually reduced (3-5 days).\n06_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch06.indd   223 16/05/19   10:48 AM",

It is not used clinically, however, because it may cause interstitial \nnephritis. Thus, the term “methicillin-sensitive” or “methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus \naureus (MRSA)” is somewhat of a misnomer because methicillin is not actually used. When \nthis term is used, think of the drugs oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and nafcillin. \nWhen Staphylococcus is sensitive to the semisynthetic penicillins, and concurrent  gram-negative \ninfection is not suspected, these are the ideal agents. They are more effective than vancomycin when \nthe organism is sensitive. These drugs are also sometimes referred to as “beta-lactamase-resistant \npenicillins” or “antistaphylococcal penicillins. ” Nevertheless, the latter term is somewhat misleading \nbecause they are also effective against a number of streptococci, such as S. pneumoniae , the Viridans \ngroup, and groups A, B, C, and G Strep.\nPenicillin G, penicillin VK, ampicillin, and amoxicillin\nThese agents are effective against streptococci, such as S. pyogenes , viridans group streptococ -\nci, and S. pneumonia , but not against staphylococci. \n• All of the agents can be useful against gram-negative bacteria such as Neisseria .\n• Ampicillin and amoxicillin are effective against staph only when  ampicillin is \ncombined with the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam  or when amoxicillin is \ncombined with clavulanate . \n• Ampicillin has some activity against E. coli . \n• Both ampicillin and amoxicillin are effective against enterococci and Listeria. \nCephalosporins\nThe first- and second-generation cephalosporins all cover the same range of organisms that the \nsemisynthetic penicillins cover, i.e., staphylococci and streptococci, plus some  gram-negative \norganisms. \n• First-generation agents ( cefazolin, cefadroxil, cephalexin ) only reliably cover Morax -\nella and E. coli . \n• Second-generation agents ( cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefuroxime, cefprozil,  loracarbef ) \nwill cover everything a first-generation cephalosporin covers, as well as a few more \ngram-negative bacilli such as Providencia , Haemophilus , Klebsiella , Citrobacter , \nMorganella , and Proteus . \n• Third-generation agents, particularly ceftazidime, are not reliable in their staphylo -\ncoccal coverage.\n• Fourth-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime will cover staph and strep, although \nthis should never be the answer when the infection is exclusively gram-positive.\nFor those with allergy to penicillin, there is only a <1% risk of cross-reaction with cephalo -\nsporins. When this reaction occurs it is seldom an anaphylactic reaction. \n• When the allergic reaction is described as a rash, a cephalosporin can safely be used. \n• When the allergic reaction is severe, e.g. anaphylaxis, a cephalosporin should not be used.\n• For minor infections, use a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin), or one of the \nnew fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin).\n• For serious infections in those with a life-threatening penicillin allergy, use vancomy -\ncin, linezolid, or daptomycin.Note\nOn the exam, your answers \nshould correspond most \nspecifically to the organism \nyou are treating.

    "page_236": "Chapter 7   ●  Infectious Diseases\n229\nMeningitis is an infection or inflammation of the meninges, which is the connective tissue \ncovering the central nervous system (CNS). Most cases arise sporadically, and the precise \nmethod of spread of the microorganism into the CNS stem is not  determined. \nOverall, most meningitis cases are caused by viruses. \n• Streptococcus pneumoniae  is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis for all \npatients beyond the neonatal period. \n• Neisseria meningitidis,  spread by respiratory droplets, is the most common cause of \nmeningitis in adolescents. \n• Listeria monocytogenes  is more common in those with immune system defects, \nparticularly of the cellular (T-cell) immune system and sometimes neutrophil defects. \nThese defects include HIV, steroid use, leukemia, lymphoma, and various chemothera -\npeutic agents. Since neonates and the elderly have decreased T-cell immune func -\ntion,  Listeria  is more common in them.\nEven with immune deficits, Streptococcus pneumoniae  is still the most  common etiology—it is \njust that Listeria  is more  common in these patients, as compared to fully immunocompetent \npatients. Staphylococcus aureus  is more common in those who have had any form of neurosur -\ngery because instrumentation and damage to the skin introduce the organism into the CNS. \nCryptococcus  is more common in those who are HIV positive and who have profound decreas-\nes in T-cell counts to levels <100 cells.\nRocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is common in those who have been exposed to ticks in \nthe appropriate geographic area. The areas with the highest RMSF infection are in the mid-Atlan -\ntic areas, such as the Carolinas, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Lyme disease can also cause meningitis \nand is more common in the Northeast, such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Y ork, and New \nJersey. Tuberculosis and syphilis are also associated with meningitis. Viruses are the most \ncommon cause of aseptic meningitis, a syndrome in which patients present in a manner similar \nto bacterial meningitis, but CSF analysis mostly reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis and bacterial \ncultures are negative. Viruses causing aseptic meningitis include entero viruses, arboviruses (St. \nLouis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus), HIV , herpes simplex, and lymphocytic choriomeningi -\ntis virus. In the past, most of these were not diagnosed, but with the availability of PCR-based \ntesting, more cases of aseptic meningitis are being accurately classified. Group B Streptococcus \n(Streptococcus agalactiae)  is the most common cause of meningitis in the neonatal period.\nThe spread of the organism into the CNS can be by sporadic (unknown) mechanisms or by means \nof contiguous local infection or by hematogenous spread. Local infections that can lead to \nmeningitis include otitis media, sinusitis, mastoiditis, and dental infections. Hematogenous spread \ncould possibly occur from any infection but is more common with  endocarditis and pneumonia.\nClinical Presentation.  Regardless of microbiologic etiology, all forms of meningitis present with \nfever, photophobia, headache, nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness, positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs), \nas well as nausea and vomiting. Altered mental status is possible, and can make a patient appear to \nhave encephalitis. Any form of CNS infection can present with seizures. Focal neurologic deficits \ncan also occur, the most common being visual field and cranial nerve deficits. The most common \nlong-term neurologic deficit from bacterial meningitis is damage to the 8th cranial nerve.\nRash is associated with several types of meningitis. \n• Petechial rash is suggestive of Neisseria\n• Rash on the wrists and ankles with centripetal spread toward the body is  suggestive of \nRMSFNote\nIn the past, Haemophilus \ninfluenzae  was the most \ncommon cause of meningitis \nin children, but this has \nmarkedly decreased with \nthe Haemophilus  type B \nvaccine.\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   229 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

Lumbar puncture is essential for establishing the diagnosis. CT scan of the head is \nthe best initial diagnostic test if the patient has papilledema, focal motor deficits, new onset \nseizures, severe abnormalities in mental status, or immunocompromised status (HIV , immu-\nnosuppressive medications, post-transplantation). If none of the above is present, a lumbar \npuncture can be safely done without doing a CT scan of the head first, which can significantly \ndelay the diagnosis. If lumbar puncture is delayed >20–30 minutes for any reason, the best \ninitial step is to give an empiric dose of antibiotics.\nThe most accurate test for bacterial meningitis on the lumbar puncture is the culture of the \nCSF. The results are always delayed for several days, however, and are rarely available at the \ntime the initial therapy must be instituted. Protein levels are elevated most commonly with \nbacterial meningitis, but they can be elevated in any type of meningitis. Elevated protein level \nand/or decreased glucose level by themselves are relatively nonspecific findings. The opening \npressure can be elevated with any cause of meningitis.\nThe Gram stain has a limited sensitivity and is positive in 50–70% of patients at most. When \npositive, however, the Gram stain has a high degree of specificity.\nInitially, the most useful test is the cell count. Although elevated cell count by itself is \n nonspecific, the differential of the cells is useful. Only bacterial meningitis gives thousands of \ncells that are all neutrophils. A mild-to-moderate elevation in lymphocytes, with several dozen \nto several hundred cells, can occur with viral infection, Rickettsia , Lyme disease, tuberculosis, \nsyphilis, or fungal (cryptococcal) etiology. Normal CSF cell count is <5 cells/mm3, which should \nbe predominantly lymphocytes.\nSpecific diagnosis of nonbacterial meningitis is based on the nature of the organism. Lyme \ndisease and RMSF are best detected with a specific immunologic response and serology. Crypto -\ncoccus  neoformans  is detected initially with an India ink test and then later with an elevation in \nthe serum and CSF cryptococcal antigen titer. Syphilis is confirmed by the presence of a positive \nVDRL or FTA on CSF. TB is rarely detected by AFB smear. Culture for TB has a much higher \nyield, particularly on several repeated LPs. PCR can also aid in the diagnosis of TB.\nTreatment.  Empiric therapy of bacterial meningitis in adults is best achieved with vancomycin \n(because of the increasing prevalence worldwide of pneumococci with decreasing sensitivity to \npenicillins) plus a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone. Ampicillin is added to \nthose with immune defects to cover Listeria  and for patients age >50 or ≤1 month. Y ou will \nhave to recognize the risks, such as HIV , steroid use, pregnancy, or hematologic malignancies \nin the case description. Listeria  is resistant to all forms of cephalosporins. Vancomycin is used \nif you know you have definite or suspected pneumococcal  resistance to penicillin or if there is \na chance of staphylococcal infection after neurosurgery. Lyme disease is best treated with \nceftriaxone. Cryptococcus  is treated initially with amphotericin. This is followed by fluconazole \ntherapy in HIV-positive patients for life or until the patient is on HAART (highly active \nantiretroviral therapy) and is asymptomatic with CD4 count >100/μL for at least 3–6 months. \nNeurosyphilis is treated with high-dose IV penicillin. TB meningitis is treated in the same \nfashion as you would use for pulmonary TB (though a longer duration of 9–12 months of \ntherapy is given). Steroid use in adult meningitis is appropriate for TB meningitis and bacterial \nmeningitis. There is no treatment currently proven useful for viral (or aseptic) meningitis.Clinical Pearl\nIn patients presenting with \nsymptoms and signs of \nmeningitis, treat empirically for \nbacterial meningitis while \nawaiting test results from the \nlumbar puncture.\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   230 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

In the case of  bacterial brain \nabscess, examination of the abscess fluid (obtained by stereotactic aspiration or surgical \nexcision of the abscess) for Gram stain and culture is essential. In HIV-positive patients, 90% \nof brain lesions will be either toxoplasmosis or lymphoma. This is the only circumstance where \nempiric therapy is sufficient to establish a specific diagnosis. If the  lesion responds to 10–14 \ndays of therapy with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, continue to administer this therapy, as it \naccurately predicts cerebral toxoplasmosis.\nTreatment.  Almost always, successful treatment requires a combination of surgical and medical \nmanagement. Stereotactic aspiration (preferred) and surgical excision of the abscess are the \nmethods used; the latter is rarely used nowadays because of significant complications.\nWith the exception of HIV-positive patients who are best treated with pyrimethamine and \nsulfadiazine, therapy should be based on the specific etiology found. One example of a \ncombination of therapy is penicillin, metronidazole, and a third-generation cephalosporin, \nsuch as ceftazidime. Penicillin would cover the streptococci, metronidazole the anaerobes, and \nceftazidime the gram-negative bacilli.\nHEAD AND NECK INFECTIONS\nOtitis Media\nOtitis media is an infection of the middle ear between the eustachian tube and the  tympanic \nmembrane. Viral upper respiratory infection can cause edema of the eustachian tube, which \noften leads to middle ear infection. The most common organisms are Strep pneumoniae  \n(35–40%), H. influenzae  (nontypeable; 25–30%), and Moraxella catarrhalis  (15–20%). Viruses \nprobably account for the rest of the cases. This is roughly the same breakdown of organism \ntype and frequency that occurs in bronchitis and sinusitis.\nPatients complain of ear pain, fever, and decreased hearing. On physical examination a red, \nbulging tympanic membrane is found, with loss of the light reflex. The most sensitive clinical \nfinding is  immobility of the membrane on insufflation of the ear with air . Perforation of the \ntympanic membrane with otorrhea occurs rarely.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination of the ear. Radiologic tests are not useful. A \nspecific bacteriologic diagnosis can be obtained with tympanocentesis for culture, but that is \nrarely performed.\nTreatment.  Oral therapy with amoxicillin is still the best initial therapy. Amoxicillin-  clavulanate \nis used if there has been recent amoxicillin use or if the patient does not respond to amoxicillin. \nOther alternatives to amoxicillin-clavulanate are second-generation cephalosporins, such as \ncefuroxime, loracarbef, or cefprozil, or third-generation agents, such as cefdinir or cefixime. \nPatients with severe penicillin allergy should receive a macrolide such as azithromycin or \nclarithromycin. New fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin are \nmicrobiologically acceptable but are broader coverage than necessary and should not be used in \nchildren (concern for arthropathy). TMP/SMZ is sometimes used but is poorly active against \nStreptococcus pneumoniae .\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   233 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

Fever occurs in about 50% \nof cases. Tooth pain also occurs because of the proximity of the sinuses to the teeth.\nDiagnosis.  Obvious cases of sinusitis do not always need radiologic confirmation prior to \ntreatment. Sinus x-rays are of little value, and routine imaging as a rule is not recommended. If \nimaging is required because of concern for complications, uncertain diagnosis, or lack of \nresponse to treatment, CT scan of the sinuses is the test of choice since it provides greater \ndetail. Occasionally, sinus puncture is necessary to confirm a specific bacteriologic etiology, \nparticularly when the patient does not respond to therapy or if there are frequent  recurrences.\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   234 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

The drugs used are in the same order and type as those \nlisted above for otitis media because the microbiology is almost identical.\nMost cases of viral rhinosinusitis resolve in 7–10 days with symptomatic management (antihis-\ntamines, NSAIDs, and decongestants). If symptoms persist beyond that point or get worse, \nantibiotics should be considered.\nPharyngitis\nPharyngitis is irritation or inflammation of the back of the throat (or the pharynx).  Although \nmost pharyngeal infections are caused by viruses, the most important cause is group A \n beta-hemolytic streptococci ( S. pyogenes ). This is because of the possibility of the organism \nprogressing on to rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis. S. pyogenes  only accounts for \n15–20% of cases of pharyngitis.\nSore throat with cervical adenopathy and inflammation of the pharynx with an exudative \ncovering is highly suggestive of S. pyogenes . Most viruses do not give an exudate, although the \nEpstein-Barr virus can. Mild S. pyogenes  infections may not give an exudate, and this is one of \nthe reasons diagnostic testing is useful.

Chest x-ray is normal.\nBronchitis is an infection of the lung, limited to the bronchial tree with limited involvement of \nthe lung parenchyma. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (COPD) are often difficult to \ndistinguish from a pneumonia until chest x-ray is performed.\nAcute bronchitis  is an acute inflammation of the tracheobronchial tube. The vast majority of \ncases are caused by viruses. S. pneumoniae  and H. influenzae  have not been implicated. A small \npercentage of nonviral cases are due to M. pneumoniae , C. pneumoniae , and B. pertussis . \nThe most common organisms responsible for  chronic bronchitis  are similar to those causing \nsinusitis and otitis media ( Streptococcus pneumoniae , nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae , and \nMoraxella).  Viruses account for a significant percentage but are often not confirmed. Cigarette \nsmoking is the most common causative factor; even 1 cigarette per day is enough to paralyze the \ncilia, which clear the bronchial tree of mucus and inhaled impurities, for 24 hours.\nPatients present with a cough often accompanied by sputum production. A bacterial etiology is \nsuggested by discolored sputum, but it is impossible to determine the specific bacterial etiology \nby sputum characteristics alone. Although the lung exam may reveal rales, patients most \ncommonly have clear lungs. Signs of consolidation, such as increased fremitus, are absent. \nLow-grade fever may be present, but patients are most commonly afebrile.\nDiagnosis.  Signs of respiratory infection, such as cough and sputum, with a normal chest \nx-ray confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment.  Mild acute cases often do not require therapy because they are often caused by viruses \nthat resolve spontaneously. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis can be treated with amoxicil -\nlin, doxycycline, or TMP/SMZ, if there has not been recent antibiotic use. Repeated infection or \npatients not responding to amoxicillin should be treated with any of the following: amoxicillin/\nclavulanate, clarithromycin, azithromycin, oral second- or third-generation cephalosporins, or the \nnew fluoroquinolones, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin.\nLung Abscess\nA 58-year-old alcoholic man was admitted last night for several weeks of cough, \nsputum, and fever.

    "page_247": "240\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nPatients with pneumonia present with cough, fever, and often sputum production. Severe \npneumonia of any cause may present with dyspnea. The quality and degree of sputum pro -\nduced might provide useful clues to the microbiologic etiology of pneumonia at the initial pre -\nsentation. Bacterial infections such as S. pneumoniae , Haemophilus , and Klebsiella  have signifi -\ncant purulent sputum production because they are infections of the alveolar air space. \n• The sputum with S. pneumoniae  is described as rusty. The “rust” is simply hemo -\nptysis. As the blood oxidizes, it becomes brownish-red color. Any form of persistent \ncough may be associated with hemoptysis, however, and hemoptysis by itself is \nnonspecific. \n• The sputum with Klebsiella  pneumoniae  is described as currant jelly. This is simply \nhemoptysis with mucoid characteristics from a combination of the necrotizing nature \nof Klebsiella  with the organism’s thick mucopolysaccharide coating. \n• Interstitial infections such as those caused by Pneumocystis  pneumonia (PCP), viruses, \nMycoplasma , and sometimes Legionella  often give a nonproductive or “dry” cough.\nAny cause of pneumonia may be associated with pleuritic chest pain. This is pain worsened by \ninspiration. Commonly, pleuritic pain is associated with lobar pneumonia, such as that caused by \nPneumococcus . This is because of localized inflammation of the pleura by the infection. Lobar \npneumonia is the type most commonly associated with signs of consolidation on examination.\nOn physical examination pneumonia presents with rales, rhonchi, or signs of lung consolida-\ntion, including dullness to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, increased vocal fremitus, and \negophony (E to A changes).\nThe respiratory rate is essential in determining the severity of a pneumonia. The respiratory \nrate is often a close correlate of the level of oxygenation. Severe pneumonia leads to hypoxia, \nwhich leads to hyperventilation.\nOrganism-specific presentations are as follows:\n• Mycoplasma —Dry cough and chest soreness. Dyspnea is rare. Bullous myringitis and \nanemia from hemolysis from cold agglutinin disease are occasionally present. Patients \nwith Mycoplasma pneumoniae  rarely need to be admitted to the hospital; therefore, \nany patient presented to you as an inpatient is less likely to have  Mycoplasma .\n• Legionella —CNS manifestations such as confusion, headache, and lethargy. GI mani -\nfestations include diarrhea and abdominal pain.\n• PCP—Marked dyspnea, particularly on exertion, with chest soreness with cough in an \nHIV-positive person. Patients invariably have AIDS with a CD4 count of <200/μL.\nDiagnosis.  The most important initial test for any type of pneumonia is the chest x-ray. \nBesides being able to simply show the presence of disease, the chest x-ray gives the initial clue \nto determining the diagnosis. The most important initial clue to the diagnosis is whether the \ninfiltrates are localized to a single lobe of the lung or whether they are bilateral and interstitial. \nS. pneumoniae  (and other causes of “typical” pneumonia) usually appear as a lobar pneumonia \nwith parapneumonic pleural effusion. Interstitial infiltrates are associated with PCP , viral, \nMycoplasma , Chlamydia , Coxiella , and sometimes Legionella  pneumoniae. Sputum should be \nobtained for both Gram stain as well as culture. Sputum culture is the most specific diagnostic \ntest for lobar pneumonia, such as with S. pneumoniae , Staphylococcus , Klebsiella , and \nHaemophilus . The other organisms (viral, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia,  Coxiella , etc.), the so-called \n“atypical” organisms, will not show up on a Gram stain or regular bacterial culture for various \nreasons. Occasionally, more invasive tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis such as \n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   240 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

Ultimately, the most \nspecific diagnostic test for pneumonia is with an open lung biopsy.\nOrganism-specific diagnostic methods are as follows:\n• Mycoplasma —Specific serologic antibody titers. Cold agglutinins have both limited \nspecificity and sensitivity.\n• Legionella —Specialized culture media with charcoal yeast extract, urine antigen tests, \ndirect fluorescent antibodies, and antibody titers.\n• PCP—Bronchoalveolar lavage, increased LDH\n• Chlamydia pneumoniae , Coxiella , Coccidioidomycoses , and Chlamydia psittaci —All of \nthese are diagnosed with specific antibody titers.\nTreatment.  Treatment depends on whether the patient has a mild disease that can be treated \nas an outpatient or a more severe illness that must be treated with IV antibiotics as a hospital-\nized inpatient. The major determinants of severity are the degree of hypoxia, such as a Po2 <60 \nmm Hg, oxygen saturation <94% on room air, or a respiratory rate >30/min; confusion or \ndisorientation; uremia; and hypotension (systolic BP <90 mm Hg and diastolic BP <60 mm \nHg). Other markers of severity are high fever, hypothermia, leukopenia (WBC <4,000/mm3), \nrapid pulse (>125/min), hyponatremia, or dehydration as determined by an elevated BUN. \nPatients with serious underlying diseases such as cancer, liver disease, renal disease, or chronic \nlung disease often do better in hospital with IV medications.\nThe specific organism causing pneumonia is rarely, if ever, known at the time that the initial \ntherapeutic decision must be made. Empiric therapy for pneumonia managed as an  outpatient is \nwith a macrolide, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin. This is because of the high  frequency of \nMycoplasma  and Chlamydia pneumoniae  as the cause of less severe  community-acquired pneumo -\nnia (CAP).

Empiric therapy of hospital-acquired \npneumonia is with third-generation cephalosporins with antipseudomonal activity (such as \nceftazidime) or carbapenems (such as imipenem) or with beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor \ncombinations (such as piperacillin/tazobactam) and coverage for MRSA with vancomycin or \nlinezolid. Aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin) are often added to empiric \ngram-negative coverage for synergy and to ensure that the patient might be getting at least one \ndrug if the bacteria are multidrug resistant. Antibiotic therapy can then be adjusted when \nresults of cultures (sputum, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and/or pleural) become available.\nTreatment of specific organisms is as follows:\n• Haemophilus influenzae —Second- or third-generation cephalosporins\n• Mycoplasma —Macrolides, doxycycline, or a quinolone\n• Legionella —Macrolides, doxycycline, or a quinolone\n• Pneumocystis  pneumonia—Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ).  \nSteroids should be used if the infection is severe.

It is, at best, 50% effective and is never indicated for routine use in the United \nStates. \nBesides immigrants, TB occurs predominantly in persons with specific risk for exposure, \nsuch as alcoholics, healthcare workers, prisoners, homeless shelter residents, nursing home \nresidents, and chronically debilitated patients whose weakened immune systems allow for \nmore frequent re-activation of latent infection. Impairment of T-cell–mediated cellular \nimmunity is the most significant defect associated with re-activation.

The culture is also necessary in order to do sensitiv -\nity testing. \n• Pleural biopsy is the single most sensitive diagnostic test. A single pleural biopsy can \nhave up to 75% sensitivity. TB will give caseating necrosis on biopsy of any tissue.\nDo not use PPD testing to diagnose acute cases of TB. PPD is relatively insensitive and \nnonspecific particularly with acute illness.\nTreatment.  Initial therapy of TB before the results of sensitivity testing are known consists of \n4-drug therapy with isoniazid (INH), rifampin (Rif), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol \n(ETB). All 4 drugs are continued for the first 2 months or until sensitivity testing is known. \nPZA and ETB are then discontinued, and therapy continues with INH and rifampin for \nanother 4 months. This makes routine therapy last for a total of 6 months. The fourth drug, \nETB, is given if the sensitivity is not known. The only forms of TB that definitely must be \ntreated for longer than 6 months are TB meningitis (12 months), TB in pregnancy (9 months), \nand osteomyelitis. HIV-positive persons may be treated for 6–9 months, but there is no clear \nevidence that 9 months is necessary, i.e., even in HIV-positive persons, 6 months of therapy is \neffective. INH use should generally be combined with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) to prevent \nperipheral neuropathy that can be a side effect of INH.\nPregnant patients should not receive PZA or streptomycin. Steroid use with TB medications is \nonly your answer for TB meningitis and TB pericarditis.\nAll of the TB medications can cause liver toxicity, except streptomycin. INH also causes \nperipheral neuropathy because of pyridoxine deficiency. Rifampin is associated with causing a \nbenign change in the color of all bodily fluids to orange/red. This color is dangerous only \nbecause it could stain contact lenses and white underwear. Ethambutol is associated with optic \nneuritis, which can cause color blindness and other visual disturbances. PZA can cause a \nbenign hyperuricemia. Don’t treat the hyperuricemia unless there are symptoms of gout \nassociated with it, which rarely occurs.Clinical Pearl\nNewer tests may provide TB \nsensitivity testing in a few \nweeks, thus the period of \nusing 4 drugs is significantly \nshortened.\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   244 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

The PPD test and interferon gamma release \nassay (IGRA) are used to screen asymptomatic populations at risk of TB to see if they have been \nexposed and are at increased risk of re-activating the disease. The AFB stain and culture of the \naffected tissues should be performed. PPD is considered positive based on the amount of \ninduration of the skin 48–72 h after the intradermal (not subcutaneous) injection of the PPD. \nErythema is irrelevant. A positive PPD or IGRA roughly indicates a 10% lifetime risk of develop -\ning TB in HIV-negative persons. Most of the active cases will develop within the first 2 years after \nconverting to a positive test. HIV-positive persons have a roughly 7–10% risk per year of \ndeveloping active disease. Previous BCG vaccination does not alter these recommendations. The \ncutoffs are as follows:\n≥5 mm:\n• Close contacts of active TB cases\n• HIV-positive persons\n• Abnormal chest x-ray consistent with old, healed TB\n• Steroid use or organ transplantation recipients\n≥10 mm:  High-risk groups, such as healthcare workers, prisoners, and nursing home \nresidents; recent immigrants (within 5 years) from areas with a high prevalence; home -\nless patients; persons with immunocompromise other than those described, such as \nthose with leukemia, lymphoma, diabetics, dialysis patients, and injection drug users \nwho are HIV-negative or whose HIV status is unknown; and children <4 years of age, \nor infants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults at high risk of TB.\n≥15 mm:  Low-risk populations, i.e., not the people described, i.e., people who should \nnever have been tested in the first place.\nTwo-Stage Testing:  Those in whom there has not been a recent PPD test and now show some \nreactivity that is <10 mm should have a second test within 2 weeks. This is to make sure the first test \nwas not a false negative. A reaction of >10 mm on the second test is simply a positive test, not a \nrecent converter. Y ou cannot make a PPD-negative person become positive with repeated testings.\nAll patients who test positive on the PPD test or IGRA should have a chest x-ray to see if they \nhave early asymptomatic evidence of TB on their film. Those with abnormal chest x-rays \nshould have 3 sputum AFB stains done to see if they have active disease. Positive AFB smears \nindicate the need for the start of 4 TB drugs as described.\nPatients with positive PPD tests or IGRA and no evidence of active disease should receive \ntherapy with 9 months of INH and vitamin B6. A normal chest x-ray or an abnormal x-ray and \n3 negative AFB stains of sputum are sufficient to exclude active disease. Although 6 months of \nINH/B6 is an acceptable alternative, the recommendation is that all patients, including those \nwho are HIV positive, should receive the same 9-month course of therapy. Previously, this was \nreferred to as “prophylaxis. ” The proper designation is now “treatment of latent TB. ”\nThe IGRA is not altered at all with previous BCG vaccine. The IGRA has the same meaning \nand treatment as a positive PPD skin test. Previous BCG vaccination does not alter these \nrecommendations in any way. Previous BCG will not make the IGRA positive.\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   245 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

The most important feature of any person presenting with possible food \npoisoning is the presence or absence of blood in the stool . Blood is most commonly associated \nwith invasive enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella , Shigella , Yersinia , invasive  \nE. coli , and Campylobacter . The time between the development of the diarrhea from the ingestion \nof the food is not as important as the presence of blood. Incubation times are helpful only if you \nhave a group outbreak and you can pinpoint a common source of contamination. In other words, \nthe last thing you eat is not necessarily the thing that was  contaminated. The invasive enteric \npathogen may be causing infection in the absence of blood, however, and the absence of blood \ndoes not exclude them. Campylobacter  is rarely associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome.\nIngestion of ciguatera toxin causes symptoms within 2–6 hours, which includes paresthesias, \nnumbness, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. In severe cases symptoms can be \nneurologic (weakness, reversal of hot-cold sensations), and cardiovascular (hypotension). \nNeurologic symptoms can be severe, progressive, and debilitating. \nThere is no specific therapy to reverse ciguatera poisoning. The most commonly implicated \nfish are barracuda, red snapper, and grouper.\n• E. coli  0157:H7 and Shigella  are associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).\n• Bacillus cereus  and Staphylococcus  predominantly present with vomiting within  \n1–6 hours of their ingestion because they contain a preformed toxin. They can cause \ndiarrhea later.\n• Giardia , Cryptosporidium , Cyclospora , and most other protozoans do not cause bloody \ndiarrhea. The major protozoan associated with blood in the stool is Entamoeba \nhistolytica .\n• Viruses can give voluminous watery diarrhea but do not cause bloody diarrhea.\nScombroid is a type of poisoning that occurs after ingestion of scombroid fish (tuna, mackerel, \nmahi mahi), which may contain a lot of histamine. When ingested, scombroid can give \nsymptoms within a few minutes: rash, diarrhea, vomiting, and wheezing, along with a burning \nsensation in the mouth, dizziness, and paresthesias.\nDiagnosis.  When there is no blood present in the stool, determine the etiology of the diarrhea \nvia a stool test for the presence of WBCs with methylene blue testing.

In women it is found on the vulva, vagina, and perineum. \nHealing is slow, and there is scar formation. It looks like condyloma lata or carcinoma.\nDiagnosis is made clinically and by performing a Giemsa or Wright stain (Donovan bodies) or \nsmear of lesion. Also do punch biopsy. Treat with doxycycline, ceftriaxone, or TMP/SMZ. \nErythromycin is an alternative.\nphil.cdc.gov\nFigure 7-9.

Itching and soreness usually precede them. Lesions are \ncommonly seen on the penis (men) and on the labia, clitoris, perineum, vagina, and cervix \n(women).\nThe ulcers are scarring and there can be inguinal lymphadenopathy. \n• Diagnosis is made with the direct fluorescent antibody test or HSV PCR. Tzanck test \nand culture are no longer used. \n• Serology is not useful for diagnosing herpes infections. \n• Treat with oral acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir. Make sure to educate the patient \nabout the relapsing nature of the disease. Those with frequent recurrence should be \ngiven chronic suppressive therapy.\n• Foscarnet is used for resistant herpes.\nGenital Warts\nGenital warts are also known as condylomata acuminata or venereal warts. They are caused by \nthe papilloma virus. \nGenital warts are commonly found on warm, moist surfaces in the genital areas. They appear \nas soft, moist, minute, pink, or red swellings which grow rapidly and become pedunculated. \nTheir cauliflower appearance makes them unique in appearance.\nDiagnosis is made by clinical appearance. Differentiation must be made between flat warts \nand condylomata lata of secondary syphilis.

For the last several days, \nshe has burning on urination with increased frequency and urgency to urinate.\nCystitis is infection of the urinary bladder. It is very common, mostly in women. In the United \nStates, it causes 6 million office visits each year.\nEtiology.\n• Roughly the same as for pyelonephritis\n• Any cause of urinary stasis or any foreign body predisposes\n• Tumors/stones/strictures/prostatic hypertrophy/neurogenic bladder\n• Sexual intercourse in women (“honeymoon cystitis”)\n• Catheters are a major cause, and the risk is directly related to the length of catheter -\nization (3–5% per day).\n• Microbiology: E. coli  in >80%; second are other coliforms (gram-negative bacilli) such \nas Proteus , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , etc.; enterococci occasionally, and Staph. sapro -\nphyticus  in young women.\nCommon presenting symptoms include dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain. Less \ncommon symptoms include hematuria, low-grade fever; foul-smelling and cloudy urine. On \nexam, there is suprapubic tenderness but no flank tenderness.\nDiagnosis\n• Best initial test is the urinalysis looking for WBCs, RBCs, protein, and bacteria; WBCs \nare the most important.\n• Nitrites are indicative of gram-negative infection.\n• A count of <5 WBCs is normal.\n• Urine culture with >100,000 colonies of bacteria per mL of urine confirmatory but not \nalways necessary with characteristic symptoms and a positive urinalysis.\nTreatment\n• For uncomplicated cystitis, 3 days of TMP/SMZ, 5 days of nitrofurantioin, or 1 dose \nof fosfomycin\n• Do not use quinolones\nAcute Bacterial Pyelonephritis\nAcute bacterial pyelonephritis is an acute patchy, most often unilateral, pyogenic infection of \nthe kidney. Infection usually occurs by ascension after entering the urethral meatus. \n• Predisposing factors include obstruction due to strictures, tumors, calculi,  prostatic \nhypertrophy, or neurogenic bladder, vesicoureteral reflux\n• Women > men\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   258 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

Confirm with clean-catch urine for urinalysis,  culture, \nand sensitivity. In the majority of cases,  >100,000 bacteria/mL of urine .\nRoutine imaging is not required, but if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours or complica-\ntions are suspected (obstruction, renal, or perinephric abscess), consider U/S or CT.\nTreatment.  Antibiotics for 10–14 days (fluoroquinolone), or ampicillin and gentamicin, or a \nthird-generation cephalosporin are all acceptable. Essentially, any of the antibiotics for \ngram-negative bacilli are effective.\n• Do not use nitrofurantoin,  as its effectiveness has been proven only in the lower \nurinary tract.\n• Do not use TMP/SMZ for empiric therapy until culture results and antibiotic \n sensitivity results are available, because of its increasing resistance throughout the \nUnited States.\nMost patients can be treated as outpatients, though pregnant women who appear very ill \nand those unable to tolerate oral medication due to nausea or vomiting should initially be \nhospitalized. \nPerinephric Abscess\nPerinephric abscess is a collection of infected material surrounding the kidney and generally \ncontained within the surrounding Gerota fascia. It is very uncommon. Although any factor \npredisposing to pyelonephritis is contributory, stones are the most important and are present \nin 20–60%. Other structural abnormalities, recent surgery, trauma, and diabetes are also \nimportant.\nPathophysiology\n• Arises from contiguous pyelonephritis that has formed a renal abscess\n• Rupture occurs through the cortex into the perinephric space\n• Microbiology: 1) The same coliforms as in cystitis and pyelonephritis; 2) E. coli  most \ncommon, then Klebsiella , Proteus ; 3) Staph. aureus  sometimes accounts for hematog -\nenous cases\nSigns and Symptoms\n• Often insidious; 2–3 weeks of symptoms prior to first physician visit\n• Fever is the most common symptom\n• Flank pain/palpable abdominal mass/abdominal pain\n• Persistence of pyelonephritis-like symptoms despite treatment for pyelonephritis\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   259 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

Fever and \npyuria with negative urine culture or polymicrobial urine culture are suggestive.\nImaging is essential; U/S is the best initial scan but CT or MRI scan offers better imaging. \nAspiration of the abscess is needed for definitive bacteriologic diagnosis.\nTreatment.\n• Antibiotics for gram-negative rods\n• Third-generation cephalosporins, antipseudomonal penicillin, or ticarcillin/clavula -\nnate, often in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example\n• Antibiotics alone are unlikely to be successful. Drainage (usually percutaneous) is \nnecessary.\nBONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS\nOsteomyelitis\nA 59-year-old man was admitted last night because of a painful leg for 2 weeks. \nOver the last 4 days, he developed an ulcer over the proximal portion of his tibia \njust below the knee. He has a history of peripheral vascular disease and diabetes. \nHe is afebrile. He has a sinus tract in the center of the red, inflamed ulcer that is \ndraining purulent material.\nOsteomyelitis is an infection of any portion of the bone including marrow, cortex, and perios -\nteum. There are  3 types:\n• Acute hematogenous  occurs mostly in children in the long bones of the lower \nextremities and is secondary to a single organism 95% of the time. The most common \norganism is Staphylococcus aureus.  The most commonly involved bones are the tibia \nand femur, and the location is usually metaphyseal due to the anatomy of the blood \nvessels and endothelial lining at the metaphysis. In adults, hematogenous osteomyelitis \naccounts for about 20% of all cases and the most common site is the vertebral bodies \n(lumbar vertebrae are most frequently involved). The infection can extend posteriorly \nto form an epidural abscess. A patient with this diagnosis would present with fever \nand back tenderness.\n• Secondary to contiguous infection  can occur in anyone with recent trauma to an \narea or placement of a prosthetic joint. Although this is secondary to a single organ -\nism most of the time, a higher percentage is polymicrobial in origin.  \nS. aureus  is the most common organism.\n• Vascular insufficiency  is mostly seen age >50, with diabetes or peripheral vascular \ndisease, resulting in repeated minor trauma that is not noticed because of neuropathy \nand decreased sensation. It is most common in small bones of the lower extremities. \nThe majority is polymicrobial, but the single most common organism is still S. aureus.Note\nInjection drug use is a \nsignificant risk factor for \nvertebral osteomyelitis in \nadults.\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   260 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

With vascular \ninsufficiency, there is often an obvious overlying or nearby ulceration or wound. Occasionally, \na draining sinus tract is present.\nDiagnosis.  The earliest tests to detect osteomyelitis are the technetium bone scan and the MRI. \nBoth have equal sensitivity for early pick-up, but the MRI can allow better differentiation between \nthe overlying soft-tissue infection and bone. The MRI can be less readily available, however.\n• Plain x-ray:  Usually the initial test because it is more easily obtained, easily read, and \ninexpensive. Periosteal elevation is the first abnormality visible. The disadvantage is \nthat 50–75% of bone calcification must be lost before the bone itself appears abnormal, \nwhich usually takes at least 2 weeks to develop.\n• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR):  Nonspecific. It is useful to follow during \ntreatment. A normal value strongly points away from osteomyelitis.\n• Bone biopsy and culture:  This is the best diagnostic test but also the most invasive.\n• CT scan, indium, and gallium:  All 3 can be abnormal in osteomyelitis, but none are \nas specific or sensitive as the tests listed above.\nTreatment.  Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children can usually be treated with antibiotics \nalone; however, osteomyelitis in adults requires a combination of surgical (wound drainage and \ndebridement, removal of infected hardware) and antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy depends on \nthe specific isolate obtained, which must be as precise as possible because empiric treatment for \n6–12 weeks would be undesirable. A semisynthetic penicillin (oxacillin, nafcillin) or vancomycin \n(if MRSA is suspected) plus an aminoglycoside or a third-generation cephalosporin would be \nadequate until a specific diagnosis is obtained. Chronic osteomyelitis must be treated for as long as \n12 weeks of antibiotic therapy, and in some cases, even longer periods of antibiotics may be \nrequired. The other MRSA drugs are daptomycin, linezolid, ceftaroline, and tigecycline.\nSeptic Arthritis\nA 73-year-old woman was admitted to your service today with a swollen right knee \nfor the last several days. The knee has an obvious effusion and decreased mobility. \nThere is also redness and tenderness of the knee.\nSeptic arthritis is an infection of a joint due to virtually any agent. The most common etiology \nis bacterial; specifically, Neisseria gonorrhoeae , staphylococci or streptococci, but Rickettsia , \nviruses, spirochetes, etc., may also cause it. Generally, bacterial arthritis is divided into \ngonococcal and nongonococcal types.\nPathogenesis.  Sexual activity is the only significant risk factor for gonococcal septic arthritis. A \ntotal of 1–5% of people with gonorrhea will develop disseminated disease, and 25% will have a \nhistory of recent symptomatic gonorrhea. Nongonococcal bacterial arthritis is usually spread by \nthe hematogenous route. Additional routes may include bites (animal or human), direct inocula -\ntion of bacteria into the joint through surgery or trauma, or spread of infection from surround -\ning structures such as bone. Even though both normal or damaged joints can get infected, any \nprevious damage to a joint, such as from rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, previous surgery, \nprosthesis placement, gout, sickle cell disease, or the presence of certain risk factors such as IV \ndrug abuse, diabetes mellitus, or HIV infection can predispose a joint to infection. Any cause of \nbacteremia can seed the joint because the synovium does not have a basement membrane.\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   261 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

Nongonococcal:\n• Gram-positive (>85); ( S. aureus  [60%], Streptococcus  [15%], Pneumococcus  [5%])\n• Gram-negative (10–15%)\n• Polymicrobial (5%)\nPresentation includes the following:\n• Nongonococcal:  monoarticular in >85%, with a swollen, tender, erythematous joint \nwith a decreased range of motion (knee most common); skin manifestations rare\n• Gonococcal:  polyarticular in 50%; a tenosynovitis is much more common (effusions \nless common; migratory polyarthralgia common; skin manifestations with petechiae \nor purpura common)\nDiagnosis\n• Nongonococcal.  Culture of joint aspirate fluid is positive in 90–95% and Gram stain \nis positive in 40–70%. Cell count of synovial fluid is high (>50,000) and is predomi -\nnantly PMNs with a low glucose. Blood culture is positive in 50%.\n• Gonococcal.  Much harder to culture. Only 50% of joint aspirates have positive \nsynovial fluid culture; <10% of blood cultures are positive. Other sites such as cervix, \npharynx, rectum, and urethra may also be positive. In the aggregate, culture of the \nother sites has a greater yield than culturing the joint itself.\nTreatment.  Bacterial arthritis is usually treated by a combination of joint aspiration and anti -\nmicrobial therapy.\n• Nongonococcal.  In the absence of a specific organism seen on a stain or obtained \nfrom culture, good empiric coverage is nafcillin or oxacillin (or vancomycin) com -\nbined with an aminoglycoside or a third-generation cephalosporin. Combine an \nantistaphylococcal/antistreptococcal drug with a gram-negative drug.\n• Gonococcal.  Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice.\nGas Gangrene (Clostridial Myonecrosis)\nGas gangrene is the necrotizing destruction of muscle by gas-producing organisms, associated \nwith signs of sepsis. It is largely caused by the spread of infection from wounds contaminated by \nClostridium perfringens  (the toxins produced by clostridia play a significant role in tissue damage). \nIt is strongly associated with traumatic injury (50%), shrapnel in war, and motor vehicles in \npeacetime. The trauma may be as minor as an intramuscular injection; however, the wound must \nbe deep, necrotic, and without exit to the surface. Postoperative (30%), nontraumatic (20%).\nSymptoms usually begin <1–4 days of incubation after the wound; they include pain, swelling, \nand edema at the site of the wound. Later hypotension, tachycardia, and fever can occur. \nCrepitation over the site and renal failure are late developments, usually prior to death.\nDiagnosis.  A Gram stain of the wound shows gram-positive rods, but no white cells. A culture \nmay be positive for C. perfringens  as early as 1 day; however, this is not necessarily diagnostic \nbecause up to 30% of wounds can be colonized by Clostridia . Gas bubbles on x-ray are suggestive \nbut may be caused by streptococci as well. Direct visualization (usually at surgery) of pale, dead \nmuscle with a brownish, sweet-smelling discharge is ultimately diagnostic.\nTreatment.  High-dose penicillin (24 million/day) or clindamycin (if penicillin allergic) is \nnecessary, but surgical debridement or amputation is the absolute center of treatment. Hyper -\nbaric oxygen may be of benefit, but this is still controversial.Note\nGas gangrene is not common; \na large referral center may \nadmit 10 cases per year. \nHowever, incidence increases \nduring times of war.\nNote\nIn the past, uterine gangrene \nwas a major complication of \nimproper abortion.\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   262 16/05/19   11:02 AM",

The primary mechanism of HIV is infection of a particular subset of T lympho-\ncytes called CD4 cells (often called just T cells). Over time, HIV decreases the number of CD4 \ncells. As a person’s CD4 count drops, he becomes at increasing risk of developing opportunistic \ninfections and certain malignancies.\nThe mode of HIV acquisition varies around the world. \n• In the United States, the earlier part of the epidemic was fueled by men who had sex \nwith men (MSM) and injection drug use. Today, the most common risk factors are \nMSM and heterosexual intercourse. In women, the most common mode is heterosex -\nual transmission. \n• In most developing countries, including Africa, Asia, and Latin America, heterosexual \ntransmission is the primary mode. \n• There is often a 10-year lag between contracting HIV infection and developing \nthe first symptoms. That is because CD4 cells drop at a rate of 50–100/μL/year without \ntherapy. It would take 5–10 years to drop from a normal CD4 count of 700/mm3 to a \ncount of 200/mm3.\nOpportunistic Infections in AIDS\nPneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) (CD4 count <200/µL)\nPrincipal Manifestations.  pneumonia; dyspnea on exertion; dry cough; fever; chest pain; \nusually subacute onset and progression.\nPrincipal Diagnostic Test.  Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage for direct identification \nof the organism. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral, interstitial infiltrates. Pneumothorax may be \npresent and it is possible to have PCP pneumonia with a normal chest x-ray. Serum LDH is \nusually moderately elevated.\nTreatment and Side Effects\n• Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is the first-line therapy for mild-severe \ndisease and may cause a rash. Alternative therapy for mild-moderate disease is a \ncombination of dapsone and trimethoprim or primaquine and clindamycin or \natovaquone or trimetrexate (with leucovorin).\n• Pentamidine—pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia\n• Steroids are used as adjunctive therapy for any patient with severe pneumonia. Severe \nis defined with a Pao2 of <70 mm Hg or an A-a gradient of >35 mm Hg.\n• TMP/SMZ can lead to hyperkalemia and should not be given with ACE-I, ARB, or \nspironolactone.\n• TMP/SMZ can also inhibit the secretion of creatinine, leading to mild increases in \nserum creatinine (.05 mg/dL). This is not a decrease in GFR, thus the medication \nshould not be stopped .\nProphylaxis (in Order of Preference)\n• TMP/SMZ orally ( most effective ).\n• Dapsone\n• Atovaquone\n07_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch07.indd   273 16/05/19   11:03 AM",

At the present time the CD4 count provides an assessment of the \nextent of immunologic damage at the time of diagnosis and is usually the most important \nfactor when deciding the timing of therapy. It is also the strongest predictor of disease progres-\nsion and survival.

Viral load can be \ncompared to glucose level for patients with diabetes. Monitoring of viral load is the best \nmethod to monitor adequate response to therapy when the patient is on antiretroviral medica-\ntions and the goal is undetectable viremia. High viral loads indicate a greater risk of complica-\ntions of the disease and a worse prognosis. A high viral load generally indicates that the level \nof CD4 cells is going to drop more rapidly.\nOther uses of viral load testing are to determine:\n• Adequacy of response to antiretroviral medications; usually with current assays, the \ngoal is complete suppression of viremia with <50 to 70 copies of HIV-RNA/mL\nViral sensitivity/resistance monitoring\nViral sensitivity testing is done prior to initiating antiviral medications in all patients.

Patients present with hypokalemia, \nhypophosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and glycosuria. It can also cause demineralization. \n• Tenofovir has 2 formulations: alafenamide ( preferred , with fewer side effects) and \ndisoproxil.\nGiving “boosted protease inhibitors”  is the practice of giving most protease inhibitors in \ncombination with a low dose of ritonavir (also a PI). Ritonavir given alone as a PI has modest \nefficacy and significant drug interactions, but when given in a low dose with other PIs, it \ndecreases their metabolism and enables higher drugs levels of the “boosted” PI over a pro-\nlonged period of time. This increases chances of success and also decreases pill burden.\nAny regimen that increases the CD4 count and drops the viral load to undetectable amounts \nor close to undetectable amounts is considered adequate therapy . When starting medication, \na drop of at least 50% of viral load in the first month is expected to indicate adequate therapy.\nPregnant HIV-Positive Patients\nWithout treatment, approximately 25–30% of children born to HIV-positive mothers will \ntruly be HIV positive. All children at birth will carry the maternal antibody to the virus and \nwill be positive by ELISA testing, but only 25–30% will remain truly infected.\n• Pregnant women should get triple antiretroviral therapy (as do nonpregnant people).\n• C-section is should be used only when CD4 count and viral load are not controlled \nwith medications (viral load >1000 copies/mL of HIV-RNA at time of delivery).\n• Start therapy as soon as you know the patient is pregnant.\n• Intrapartum IV azidothymidine is given.\n• The baby should receive zidovudine for 6 weeks afterward. \n• The only known teratogen is efavirenz in animal studies.\nBreast Feeding\nBreast feeding is associated with transmission of the virus to the infant. If a pregnant woman is \nalready on antiretrovirals, she should continue on them. She should start immediately regard-\nless of gestational age.

When a patient develops renal disease, it usually presents \nas one of the following:\n• Proteinuria, reflecting a damaged glomerular basement membrane\n• Hematuria, reflecting inflammation\n• Declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\nTherefore, renal disease is best detected initially by urinalysis and serum creatinine.\nUrinalysis\nFor the general population, there is no recommendation for routine urinalysis. For those with \nDM, however, secondary prevention of diabetic nephropathy is recommended; microalbumin/\ncreatinine ratio on a spot urine specimen should be used and not urinalysis.Nephrology 8\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   283 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

The urine protein dipstick detects negatively charged proteins (e.g. albumin) \nbut not other proteins such as immunoglobulin light chains. Proteinuria may be \ncaused by glomerular or tubular disease, although glomerular disease leads to greater \namounts. The lower limit of detection for protein on the UA is 300 mg/24 hours, too \nhigh to sensitively screen for early diabetic nephropathy. Detected proteinuria may \nreflect renal disease, but it may also be caused by fever, CHF, or severe exercise. Any \npositive urine dipstick for protein should be followed up by a quantitative study.\n• Heme and red blood cells  (RBC). The heme dipstick is positive when RBCs are \npresent, but also when there is free hemoglobin (transfusion reactions) or myoglobin \n(rhabdomyolysis) in the urine. Red cells can be found in the urine from any cause of \ndisease in the urologic system. Etiologies are stones, cancer, bleeding disorders, \ntrauma to urinary system, and treatment such as cyclophosphamide (which causes \nhemorrhagic cystitis or glomerular disease). Hematuria is also from infections such as \ncystitis or prostatitis. The red cells change shape (dysmorphic) in some glomerular \ndisease; other clues to glomerular disease are concurrent proteinuria and RBC casts , \nwhich are pathognomonic for glomerulonephritis.\n• Nitrites . Gram-negative bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrite, which is a marker of urinary \ninfection.\n• Glucose:  Glucosuria most often reflects hyperglycemia, but may also be caused by \ndefective proximal tubular reabsorption, seen in Fanconi syndrome.\n• Bacteriuria . By itself, the isolated finding of bacteria in the urine is of very limited \nsignificance. The most important exception is in pregnant women, whom you should \nscreen for bacteria and treat. About 30% of pregnant women with bacteriuria progress \nto pyelonephritis.\n• White blood cells  (WBC) may be due to pyelonephritis, cystitis, or intrarenal inflam -\nmation (e.g. eosinophils in eosinophilic granulomatosis).

    "page_292": "285\nChapter 8   ●  Nephrology\nUrine Protein and Creatinine Concentration\nSince the UA is an imperfect screen for small amounts of proteinuria, the best test for this is \nthe spot urine collection for albumin and creatinine, which has largely replaced the 24-hour \ncollections done in the past. The ratio of albumin to creatinine is a good estimate of the \nalbumin that would have been collected in a 24 hour collection, and is much easier to do. A \n30–300 mcg albumin/mg creatinine suggests incipient diabetic nephropathy in at-risk patients, \nand would prompt starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\nSerum Creatinine, BUN, and Estimated GFR\nThe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls early in many renal diseases, without symptoms. \nSensitive testing is thus needed to detect early chronic and acute renal injury. Creatinine, a \nmetabolic product of skeletal muscle, is the main measure of GFR.\nAn isolated serum creatinine (SCr) test may be deceiving, since it may be low (0.5 mg/dL) just \nbecause of decreased muscle mass or high (1.6 mg/dL) due to large muscle bulk. More muscle \nmeans more creatinine. Therefore, serum creatinine values should always be compared to a \ngiven patient’s baseline . A doubling of the SCr means a 50% reduction in their GFR.\n• Creatinine needs some time to rise. Even if the patient becomes anuric, creatinine will \nrise only at a rate of 0.5–1.0 point per day. This rise will be faster if the body muscle \nmass is greater.\n• Hence, if the creatinine goes from 1 to 3 over a period of 2 days in a patient with renal \ninjury, this is consistent with nonfunctioning kidneys.\nGiven the limitations of the isolated serum creatinine, options for better estimation of the GFR \ninclude the creatinine clearance , which requires a 24 hour urine collection, and the estimated \nGFR (eGFR) , which requires no urine and may be calculated from the patient’s SCr, age, race, \nheight, weight, and sex. This builds an estimate of muscle mass to correct the final number. \nThe eGFR is now the most commonly used way to determine a patient’s renal function . It is \nnot useful if the patient’s SCr is not at baseline (decreasing or increasing) and should only be \nused at steady state. The same limitation applies to the creatinine clearance.\nSerum BUN is less useful than the creatinine for determining renal function. While it does \nincrease in acute or chronic kidney injury, it may also be falsely elevated even when renal \nfunction is normal, in response to increased protein load in the diet or GI bleed. The BUN is \nderived from protein waste products; blood in the gut acts like a big protein meal and is catabo -\nlized to urea. The BUN can be falsely low when there is liver disease, malnutrition, or SIADH. \nThe BUN is most useful when compared to the serum creatinine, since a ratio >20:1 may \nsuggest prerenal azotemia.\nRenal Sonography (Ultrasound)\nRenal sonography is the most common test used in renal visualization. It has several uses:\n• Detects hydronephrosis in renal obstruction, allowing prompt decompression\n• Shows small or scarred kidneys in advanced chronic kidney disease, allowing differ -\nentiation from the normal appearing kidneys seen in acute kidney injury\n• Shows renal cysts and tumors\n• Detects kidney stones in the renal pelvises\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   285 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_293": "286\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nACUTE KIDNEY INJURY\nAcute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure , is a rapid decline in the \nglomerular filtration rate (seen as a rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine) over \nseveral hours to days. There is no precise duration to define it as acute. For example, in \nrhabdomyolysis or contrast-induced renal failure, it may develop over several hours, while in \naminoglycoside toxicity it may take 1–2 weeks.\nAKI must be distinguished from chronic kidney disease  (CKD), which is the slow decline in \nGFR over years (seen in many glomerular diseases such as diabetic nephropathy). The distinc-\ntion cannot be made by a single serum creatinine test, but requires serial determinations. The \nrenal sonogram  (U/S) can also help in the distinction, as CKD often shows small or scarred \nkidneys, while AKI usually shows normal kidneys sonographically, despite the declining \nfunction.\nThere are several other terms used in the discussion of renal failure:\n• Renal insufficiency  or azotemia  is AKI, but not to the point of needing dialysis. The \nterm azotemia  literally means the buildup of azole groups or nitrogen in the blood.\n• Uremia  describes very severe AKI or CKD in which dialysis or transplantation is \nneeded to save life. The term ESRD  can be used interchangeably.\nProgressive kidney disease may life-threatening. Clinical presentation includes:\n• Hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, and fluid overload/pulmonary edema\n• Anemia, bone disease, and pericarditis\n• Bleeding diathesis due to platelet dysfunction\n• Altered mental status\nAKI is classified  as prerenal, postrenal, or intrarenal based on the site and mechanism of injury.\n• Prerenal AKI  means decreased perfusion of the kidney (e.g., CHF, renal artery \nstenosis, volume depletion). The kidney itself is healthy.\n• Postrenal AKI  indicates renal obstruction, causing decreased drainage from the \nkidney and decreased forward flow of urine (e.g., stones, prostatism, pelvic \n malignancy). The kidney itself is healthy.\n• Intrarenal AKI  means a reduction in GFR due to a renal tubular, interstitial or \nglomerular disease (e.g. glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial \nnephritis). The kidney is defective.\nInitially most AKI is asymptomatic, since uremic symptoms do not typically occur until >75% \nof GFR has been lost. It frequently is a hospital diagnosis, as AKI often accompanies severe \nillness. Clinical hints of early AKI might include decreased urine output, hypotension or \northostasis (prerenal), hypertension (intrarenal), or edema (intrarenal).\nLab evaluation : Serial measurement of the serum creatinine concentration  (SCr) should \nshow rising levels each day. Once a stable value of the SCr is reached, the estimated GFR eGFR \ncan be calculated using standard formulae. The urinalysis  and fractional excretion of sodium  \nare important to evaluate causes of intrarenal AKI. Renal U/S  helps rule out postrenal AKI. \nOther important labs to follow in monitoring AKI include serum Na, K, and HCO3, plus \nhematocrit/hemoglobin. Because they are more easily reversed, prerenal and postrenal AKI \nshould always be excluded before launching a workup of renal disease when a declining GFR \nis detected. Note\nUremia does not necessarily \nimply chronic kidney \ndisease . Although most \npatients develop uremia after \nyears of CKD, it is possible to \nbecome uremic in as little as \n1–2 weeks with a severe \nillness causing AKI (e.g., \nrhabdomyolysis).\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   286 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_294": "287\nChapter 8   ●  Nephrology\nPrerenal Acute Kidney Injury\nPrerenal azotemia is a form of AKI caused by diminished perfusion of the kidney. The kidney \nitself is normal. If the kidney could receive adequate perfusion, the BUN and creatinine would \nnormalize. The causes of prerenal azotemia include:\n• Hypovolemia: dehydration, burns, poor oral intake, diuretic, vomiting, diarrhea, \nsweating, hemorrhage, hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism\n• Hypotension: septic shock, cardiogenic shock, anaphylactic shock, hepatorenal syndrome\n• Third spacing of fluids: peritonitis, osmotic diuresis, low oncotic pressure (hypoalbu -\nminemia of cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome)\n• Decreased renal blood flow: CHF, constrictive pericarditis, renal artery stenosis, aortic \ncoarctation\n• Renal arteriolar vasoconstriction/vasodilation: hypercalcemia, cyclosporine,  \ntacrolimus, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors\nThe diagnosis is usually made by clinical exam. Volume-depleted patients present with signs of \northostatic  or frank hypotension and tachycardia . Skin turgor may be reduced, reflecting low \nextracellular volume. \nIn contrast, the prerenal AKI seen in severe CHF, constrictive pericarditis, or coarctation may \nshow edema and fluid overload, yet the kidney is receiving no/low perfusion, thus the rising BUN \nand creatinine. This demonstrates a reduction of effective arterial volume  a physiologic term for \nperfusion of organs, determined by intravascular volume, blood pressure, and cardiac output.\nLab evaluation:  Regardless of the cause of prerenal AKI, patients may show:\n• Elevated serum creatinine concentration\n• Normal urinalysis\n• Serum BUN:creatinine ratio >20:1 (normally 10:1 in other types of AKI); the BUN \nelevates because urea undergoes increased proximal tubule reabsorption in states of \nhigh sodium absorption (e.g., volume depletion)\n• Low urine sodium concentration (<10 mEq/L)\n• Low fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa <1%) because the kidney perceives the body \nas being volume-depleted, leading to a vigorous sodium and water reabsorption by the \nkidney\n• High urine osmolality (>500 mosm/kg) and specific gravity (>1.010)\nThe urine tests reflect the high renal sodium and water reabsorption driven by the low renal \nperfusion. \nRenal artery stenosis , especially if bilateral, may result in prerenal AKI with a rising creati-\nnine. The kidneys themselves are normal. Similar to the case of renal obstruction, bilateral \ndisease  is required for detectable AKI, since loss of a single kidney may be compensated by \nrecruitment of reserve nephrons in the remaining kidney, maintaining the GFR near normal.\nIn renal artery stenosis, although systemic BP may be markedly elevated (due to high renin/\nAT/aldosterone levels), the low renal blood flow still leads to AKI. Here, the elevated systemic \nBP does not matter; all that matters is how much blood is getting to the kidney. This effect is \namplified with the use of ACE inhibitors, which will additionally diminish renal perfusion in \nthis setting. Treatment is angioplasty/stenting.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   287 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_295": "288\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nHepatorenal syndrome  is AKI based entirely on the presence of hepatic failure. The kidneys \nare themselves normal. The rise in BUN and creatinine is believed to be due to an intense \nvasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole in response to systemic vasodilation caused by the \nhepatic failure. The local renal vasoconstriction causes decreased renal perfusion and AKI. The \nsyndrome does not respond to volume expansion, unlike AKI in hepatic failure due to simple \nECV volume depletion. Lab evaluation is similar to other causes of prerenal AKI. Intrinsic \nrenal disease should be excluded to make a diagnosis (e.g. patients should have a normal \nurinalysis). A key diagnostic step is lack of improvement of the SCr after a bolus infusion of \ncolloid fluid  (e.g. albumin). Treatment is correction of the underlying liver disease (e.g. liver \ntransplantation). Since the underlying physiology is systemic vasodilation, treatment with \nvasoconstrictors may be useful. Midodrine, an alpha agonist, and octreotide may be beneficial.\nACE inhibitors  may cause prerenal AKI, especially in patients with volume depletion, bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis, or other causes of prerenal AKI. The renal failure is caused by vasodila-\ntion of the efferent arteriole . Angiotensin-II constricts the efferent arteriole, a mechanism \nused to maintain glomerular perfusion pressure in the face of low blood flow. ACE inhibitors \nblock this adaptation, causing a transient decrease in GFR. Despite this ability of ACE inhibi-\ntors to worsen GFR, their overall effect on the kidney is to diminish proteinuria and the \nrate of progression to uremia and renal failure . This beneficial effect is most likely secondary \nto the decrease in intra-glomerular hypertension. ACE inhibitors decrease proteinuria by \n35–45%. This is particularly true in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nNSAIDs  may also cause prerenal AKI, especially in patients with volume depletion, bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis, or other causes of prerenal AKI. The renal failure is caused by vasocon-\nstriction of the afferent arteriole . NSAIDs inhibit the action of the vasodilatory prostaglan-\ndins that maintain dilation of the afferent arteriole, which is important in maintaining GFR in \nthe face of volume depletion. A similar effect is seen in the calcineurin inhibiting transplant \ndrugs cyclosporine and tacrolimus, which both vasoconstrict the renal arterioles, causing \nreversible prerenal AKI. NSAIDs may also affect the kidney by causing intrarenal AKI, \nspecifically acute interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, or secondary forms of membranous \nglomerulopathy and minimal change disease. \nPostrenal Acute Kidney Injury\nPostrenal azotemia is caused by any decrease in the outflow of urine. This may come by \nobstruction of any part of the renal collection system (renal pelvises to urethra). In order to \ncause AKI the obstruction must be bilateral , since obstruction of a single kidney can be \n compensated for by the remaining kidney’s recruitment of reserve nephrons, maintaining a \nnormal GFR. (This is also why donating a single kidney for transplantation does not change \nyour serum creatinine.) Common causes of postrenal AKI include:\n• Renal pelvises: bilateral stones\n• Ureters: bilateral stones, bilateral ureteral disease e.g., retroperitoneal fibrosis,  \nstrictures\n• Bladder: Stones, clots, cancer obstructing bilateral ureteral outflow.\n• Prostate: hyperplasia and cancer\n• Neurologic disease: Neurogenic bladder: patients have a history of obstructive \n symptoms followed by sudden onset of oliguria or anuria. This may be due to multiple \nsclerosis, spinal cord lesions, or peripheral neuropathy.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   288 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

After \nurinating (voiding), there should be no more than 50 mL of urine left in the bladder. If this \npost-void residual is markedly elevated, it implies an obstruction to the flow of urine out of the \nbladder.\nTreatment  is based on quickly relieving the cause of the obstruction: For bladder/prostate \ndisease, do Foley catheter insertion.

    "page_297": "290\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nTubular disorders\nAcute tubular necrosis  (ATN) is acute renal failure on the basis of tubular damage and \nnecrosis, leading to reduced solute clearance, AKI, and diminished electrolyte and water \nregulation. Causes include ischemia  and hypoperfusion of the kidney  (shock, sepsis, heart \nfailure) and tubular toxins  (aminoglycosides, contrast dyes, amphotericin, myoglobin \n[rhabdomyolysis], cisplatin).\nIschemic and toxic effects may be additive, increasing the risk of ATN. The degree, and \nespecially the duration of ischemia or toxic exposure are important to the prognosis and \nrecovery from ATN. The longer the duration of hypotension/hypoperfusion, the greater the \nchance of ATN .\nWith ATN there is often an initial phase that appears similar to prerenal AKI, as the kidney is \nhypo-perfused. Next comes a reduction/cessation of urine flow (oligo- or anuria) as the \ntubules necrose and the glomerular ultrafiltrate back-leaks into the blood instead of forming \nurine. Finally, the tubules regenerate and a polyuric phase may occur. Not all patients go \nthrough each stage; for instance, some AKI is non-oliguric (e.g., aminoglycosides).\nDiagnosis.  With ischemic ATN, the BUN and creatinine will initially rise in a 20:1 ratio \nsimilar to prerenal AKI. This reduces to 10:1 as ATN tubular injury becomes established.\nWith severe or prolonged injury, the tubular cells will necrose and slough off into the urine \nand become visible as renal tubular epithelial cells or granular/muddy brown/pigmented casts. \nThe rising serum creatinine (over days) is accompanied by reduced urine output or anuria.  \nIf available, urine findings can help to distinguish ATN from prerenal AKI.\nTable 8-2.

Volume status and serum electrolytes should be followed carefully. Treatment \nfocuses on correcting the underlying cause (no therapy can reverse the renal failure). Volume \nrepletion with normal saline is often given to make sure there is no prerenal component and \nmay reduce contrast-induced renal failure, but it does not reverse it once it occurs. Diuretics \nshould be used only with critical pulmonary edema, and do not “convert” oliguric ATN to the \nnon-oliguric type. Dialysis may be needed if uremic symptoms occur, and is stopped once the \ntubules recover.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   290 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_298": "291\nChapter 8   ●  Nephrology\nATN may be caused by filtered pigment injury to the tubules from myoglobin (in rhabdomy-\nolysis) or hemoglobin (in hemolytic anemia). Rhabdomyolysis  can be caused either by  \n(a) sudden/severe crush injury, seizures, or severe exertion, or (b) hypokalemia, hypophospha-\ntemia, or medications (e.g., statins). Large amounts of released myoglobin are filtered into the \nnephron and cause tubular toxicity and ATN. Similarly, in massive hemoglobinuria from ABO \nincompatibility filtered hemoglobin causes tubular toxicity. The toxicity is because the pigment \nis directly toxic to the tubular cells as well as from precipitation of the pigment in the tubules. \nThe degree of toxicity is related to the duration of contact of the tubular cells with the hemo-\nglobin or myoglobin, so is compounded by dehydration.\nDiagnosis:  Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria is confirmed with the following:\n• Markedly elevated serum CPK  level (a biochemical marker of skeletal muscle neuro -\nsis); for nephrotoxicity to occur, level must be in 10,000–100,000 range (normal ≤500)\n• Urinalysis dipstick positive for blood but with no red cells visible.  This is because \nmyoglobin can react with the heme reagent on the dipstick. Free hemoglobin will do \nthe same thing.\n• Rapidly rising serum creatinine level due to ATN\n• Hyperkalemia: check the ECG for peaked T waves\n• Metabolic acidosis with decreased serum bicarbonate\n• Hyperphosphatemia secondary to muscle breakdown\n• Hypocalcemia secondary to the deposition of calcium in damaged muscles and \ncomplexing with high phosphate.\n• Hyperuricemia due to release of purines from damaged muscles\nTreatment  is normal saline to increase urine output and decrease toxin contact time. If there is \nlittle response, add mannitol, an osmotic diuretic. Alkalinizing the urine with bicarbonate may \nor may not be useful.\nATN Due to Drugs.  The most common toxins that cause ATN are aminoglycosides, IV con -\ntrast agents, amphotericin, and cisplatin. For patients on multiple drugs, differentiation of \nATN from acute interstitial nephritis is often difficult, but includes:\n• Allergic interstitial nephritis occurs with the first dose, and is associated with fever, \nrash, joint pain, and eosinophils in both blood and urine. ATN lacks these.\n• Drugs causing ATN often take days to weeks to produce enough cumulative toxicity \nto cause renal failure. Symptoms are those of acute kidney injury.\nThe clinical and lab evaluation is as described in the ATN section above. There is no test which \ncan confirm a specific toxin as the etiology of the renal failure. Other causes of renal failure \nmust first be excluded, and the toxin must be identified and promptly withdrawn. There is no \nspecific therapy that can reverse the renal insufficiency of any direct-acting toxin.\n• Aminoglycosides . Aminoglycoside-related nephrotoxicity (10–20% of all drug-\ninduced nephrotoxicity) is usually reversible. Unlike contrast dyes, aminoglycoside \ntoxicity generally takes 5–10 days of administration  to result in toxicity. The \nlikelihood of toxicity is associated with high trough levels. Tobramycin is less nephro -\ntoxic than gentamicin or amikacin. Renal failure due to aminoglycosides is frequently \nnon-oliguric (so K+ levels are usually not elevated). Hypokalemia and hypomagnese -\nmia predispose the patient to aminoglycoside toxicity.\nPrevention is from limiting duration of use and by reducing trough levels  by giving the \nantibiotic once a day. Once-a-day dosing allows high bactericidal levels with the same \nefficacy and very low trough levels.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   291 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_299": "292\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\n• Amphotericin B. This antifungal agent is associated with renal insufficiency as well as \ndistal renal tubular acidosis (non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with hypokalemia and \nhigh urine pH). Like aminoglycosides, it occurs only after several days or weeks  of \namphotericin use, and is usually reversible with prompt discontinuation of the drug.\n• Contrast Agents.  Unlike the antibiotics, radiocontrast used in radiology can result in \nrenal failure in as little as 12–24 hours after the use of the agent . The rise in creati -\nnine peaks at 3–5 days after the injury. Initial vasoconstriction may be reflected in a \n“prerenal” lab picture, i.e. BUN: Cr of >20:1 and low urine Na. Underlying renal \ndisease, DM, and advanced age increase the risk for ATN.\nPrevention is with normal saline  infusion before the agent is administered. N-acetyl \ncysteine and sodium bicarbonate are often added but are of uncertain value.\n• Other Drugs. Cisplatin accumulates in tubular cells and causes ATN in 20–30% of \npatients. Pentamidine, used for pneumonia in AIDS patients, is associated with ATN \nin 20–30% of patients.\nPrecipitation of crystals  within the tubules can reduce urine flow and GFR, and may occur \nvia endogenous or exogenous (ingested) substances and drugs.\n• Uric acid  toxicity occurs via intratubular crystallization, and usually occurs in the setting \nof tumor lysis syndrome  after treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. Patients show \nAKI, oliguria, severe hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Prevention is \nwith vigorous hydration, sodium bicarbonate, and allopurinol prior to receiving chemo -\ntherapy. Allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting conversion of \nxanthine to hypoxanthine to uric acid. Uric acid stones precipitate in an acidic urine, \nunlike oxalate crystals, which precipitate in alkaline urine. Separately, gout may cause \nchronic  kidney disease through a slower and milder version of intrarenal urate deposition.\n• Oxalate crystals  cause AKI following ethylene glycol overdose  after ingestion of \nantifreeze. Patients display intoxication, an anion gap metabolic acidosis and AKI. \nDiagnosis is confirmed with oxalate crystals seen on urinalysis (oxalate crystals are \nshaped like envelopes). Treatment is normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and fomepi -\nzole to prevent the conversion of ethylene glycol to toxic oxalic acid. Separately, \nchronic hyperoxaluria and oxalate kidney stones can be caused by Crohn’s disease \nbecause of fat and calcium malabsorption.\n• Immunoglobulins and light chains  cause AKI in multiple myeloma, where renal \nfiltration of light chains may lead to their precipitation in the tubules and to direct \ntubular toxicity. Both lead to AKI. The urinalysis may be normal, since the dipstick \ndoes not detect the positively charged light chains. Diagnosis is with urine protein \nelectrophoresis.

Histopathology \nshows a robust interstitial inflammation with eosinophils. The etiology is usually an adverse \nimmunologic effect to medications that commonly cause allergies (70% of cases). These \ninclude penicillin, cephalosporins, sulfa drugs, allopurinol, rifampin, and quinolones. This \nallergic reaction can take the form of a rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hemolysis, and/or \nAIN. NSAIDs  also cause a form of AIN lacking the eosinophiluria, severe allergic signs and \nsymptoms.\nAIN is less commonly caused by infections themselves. The most common infections to result \nin AIN are leptospirosis, legionella, CMV , rickettsia, and streptococci.\nThe least common causes of AIN are several autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus \nerythematosus (SLE), Sjögren syndrome, sarcoidosis, and cryoglobulinemia. These are more \nlikely to harm the kidney via glomerulonephritis.\nFever is present in 80% of those with typical AIN. It can be very difficult to determine if the \nfever is from the underlying illness or from the AIN. Rash is present in 25–50% of patients. \nJoint pain is common because AIN acts somewhat like serum sickness.\nAIN due to NSAIDs presents with a less “allergic” reaction, usually lacking rash, fever or joint \npain, and presents with a usually-asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine.\nLab studies:  The best initial test for AIN is a urinalysis (UA) looking for white cells , then \nstaining for urine eosinophils is Hansel or Wright stain of the urine . While the kidney \nbiopsy is most accurate, it is rarely done, since patients resolve following discontinuation of the \nantibiotic. Biopsy is used only in uncertain cases. NSAID-induced AIN typically lacks  \neosinophiluria and eosinophilia.\nOther abnormalities may include eosinophilia; hematuria/mild proteinuria; and increased \nserum IgE levels.\nTreatment . AIN should resolve spontaneously after stopping the offending agent; there is no \nspecific therapy. If renal failure persists or worsens, consider a short course of steroids.\nAcute microvascular disorders\nAtheroembolic disease (cholesterol emboli syndrome). AKI may develop in some patients \nwith severe atherosclerosis following an invasive arterial procedure (e.g. an arteriogram). \nCholesterol emboli scatter throughout the body, including to the kidney. Look for a patient \nwho undergoes a vascular catheter procedure such as angioplasty who develops bluish \ndiscoloration of the fingers and toes, livedo reticularis, and AKI several days later. Labs show \nAKI with eosinophilia, low complement levels . Although the most accurate test is a skin \nbiopsy to see cholesterol crystals in the skin, this is rarely done. There is no therapy for \natheroembolic disease.\nAcute papillary necrosis  is AKI associated with occlusion of small renal capillaries, leading to \nthe ischemia and sloughing of renal papillae, the medullary segments involved in urine \nconcentration and the least oxygenated area of the kidney. It is the nephron segment most Note\nOther medications causing \nAIN include NSAIDs, \nallopurinol, and proton pump \ninhibitors.\nNote\nAny sulfa drug can cause an \nallergic reaction. Besides \nantibiotics, other examples of \nsulfa drugs are diuretics such \nas thiazides, furosemide, and \nacetazolamide.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   293 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

Papillary necrosis is seen in patients with a \nhistory of sickle cell disease, diabetes, urinary obstruction, chronic pyelonephritis or chronic \nanalgesic use, esp. NSAIDs. Volume depletion concentrates the blood and increases the risk. \nLook for the sudden onset of flank pain, hematuria, pyuria, and fever  in an at-risk patient, \nesp. those in sickle crisis. This can be very similar to acute pyelonephritis. Like pyelonephritis, \nthe urinalysis will show white and red cells. Unlike pyelonephritis there will be no bacteria, \nand no organisms grow on culture. The patient may sometimes note red “chunks” in the urine \nthat may cause confusion with kidney stones, but the referred ureteral pain of stones is absent.\nThe most accurate diagnostic test for papillary necrosis is CT scan , which will show “bumpy” \ncontours in the renal pelvis where the papillae have sloughed off. There is no specific therapy \nfor papillary necrosis.\nGLOMERULAR DISEASES\nGlomerular diseases are the most common cause of chronic kidney disease and dialysis-requiring \nrenal failure. The most common of these in the developed world is diabetic nephropathy.\nMost glomerular diseases are also called  glomerulonephritis  (GN) or inflammation of the \nglomerulus, often as the result of an autoimmune event, circulating antibodies, or vasculitis.  \nA few are non-inflammatory and caused by other mechanisms, such as hypertensive nephro-\nsclerosis (prolonged high BP), Alport syndrome (defective Type IV collagen in the glomerular \nbasement membrane), and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (microthrombi in renal small vessels). \nGN may be classified as follows:\n• Primary disease without systemic illness (e.g., membranous GN, IgA nephropathy)\n• Secondary disease due to systemic illness (e.g., post-infectious GN, diabetic nephropa -\nthy, lupus nephritis)\nBased on presentation, it may be further classified as follows:\n• Nephritic (sometimes called “acute GN”) with hematuria, RBC casts, edema, hyper -\ntension, and renal failure (e.g., post-infectious GN, Goodpasture syndrome)\n• Nephrotic with heavy proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, edema, and hypertension (e.g., \nminimal change disease, diabetic nephropathy)\n• Rapidly progressive GN: hematuria, usually nephritic, accompanied by sub-acute renal \nfailure (over 1–2 weeks), often with crescents seen on biopsy\nMany glomerular diseases can be diagnosed using clinical evaluation and specific serologies, \nbut the definitive diagnosis is usually made by renal biopsy , especially when there is heavy \nproteinuria or renal insufficiency. In these cases biopsy is usually needed, since treatment \nvaries depending on histology.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   294 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

Small or moderate pro -\nteinuria is also common.\n• The edema of glomerular disease may be anywhere in the body, but is usually first \nseen in dependent areas (ankles). It is caused by avid renal sodium retention, so labs \nshow a low urine sodium, with fractional excretion of sodium <1%.\n• With the salt and water retention, hypertension also develops.\n• Nephritic diseases show modest amounts of protein in the urine, with a daily total  \n<2 grams per 24 hrs. In contrast, nephrotic syndrome does not begin until >3.5 grams \nper 24 hrs.\n• The most important distinction between nephritic and nephrotic syndrome is the \nhematuria (in nephritic) and degree of proteinuria (>3.5 gm/24 hrs in nephrotic).\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   295 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

It can also involve the skin (50%), eyes (50%), joints, and GI tract. \nNeuropathy may be a symptom. If a patient with chronic upper and lower respiratory illness \ndoes not respond to antibiotics and then develops renal failure or hematuria, consider this \ndisorder.\nThe best initial test is the cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ C–ANCA ] or \nantiproteinase-3 antibody. The most accurate test is a biopsy of the kidney, nasal septum, or \nlung, looking for granulomas. Sinus biopsy, specifically the nasal septum, is less sensitive and \nhas more false-negative results.\n• Other lab abnormalities include elevated ESR, rheumatoid factor (50%), anemia, and \nleukocytosis.

All forms of vasculitis are characterized by fever, \nweight loss, and a generalized malaise. Diagnostic keys include a history of asthma, eosinophilia , Note\nWegener granulomatosis is \nnow called granulomatosis \nwith polyangiitis (Wegener). \nChurg-Strauss syndrome is \nnow called eosinophilic \ngranulomatosis with \npolyangiitis.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   296 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

The most accurate test is a lung biopsy  showing the granulomas and eosino -\nphils. Treatment is cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids.\nPolyarteritis nodosa  (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis of small- and medium-sized arteries that \naffects virtually every organ in the body except the lung . Renal involvement is common and \nmanifests as hypertension, renal insufficiency, and hemorrhage due to microaneurysms. Like \nall vasculitis, PAN is associated with fever, weight loss, and malaise. Other organs involved \ninclude the skin, eyes, muscles, GI tract, heart, kidneys, and neurologic system. Abdominal \npain and joint pain may be prominent. The abdominal pain may mimic mesenteric ischemia, \nand the pain will occur with eating. Anemia and an elevated sedimentation rate are present but \nare too nonspecific to be useful.\nA diagnostic key for PAN is multiorgan vasculitis, sparing the lungs . The most accurate \ndiagnostic test is biopsy of an affected area , with sural nerve biopsy  being particularly high \nyield especially if there are neurologic symptoms. If there is abdominal pain, an angiogram of \nthe involved vessels in the GI tract may eliminate the need for a biopsy.\n• Hepatitis B is seen in 10–30% of patients (especially injection drug users).\n• P-ANCA is seen in only a minority of patients.\nTreatment is glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide.\nRenal disease from cryoglobulinemia  shows the lesion of membranoproliferative GN (type 1) \nand is associated with chronic hepatitis C , and less commonly hepatitis B. The presentation \nmay be nephritic and/or nephrotic . Besides the renal disease, cryoglobulinemia is associated \nwith joint pain, neuropathy, and purpuric skin lesions. There is no GI involvement. There is \nelevated ESR and low levels of complement. Keys to diagnosis are hepatitis C and positive \nserum cryoglobulins. Treatment is for the underlying chronic hepatitis. For severe disease \n(renal failure, heavy proteinuria), pulse doses of steroids and plasmapheresis may help.\nNephritic glomerular diseases\nThe following disorders show a nephritic clinical presentation, but the disease process is \nlimited to the glomerulus.\nPostinfectious GN  is the classic nephritic disease, with dark urine, hypertension, and edema \ndeveloping suddenly  1–2 weeks after strep pharyngitis . If not caused by group A beta \nhemolytic streptococci ( Streptococcus pyogenes ), it may be caused by throat or skin infection \nwith Streptococcus pyogenes  (although rheumatic fever occurs only with the strains that cause \npharyngitis). Poststreptococcal GN occurs in 10–15% of patients with pharyngitis infected \nwith a nephritogenic strain.\nVirtually any infectious agent can cause postinfectious GN, including hepatitis B and C, CMV , \nand chronic staphylococcal infections such as endocarditis. In the pre-antibiotic era, GN was \nthe most common cause of death from endocarditis. The disease is usually self-limited, so it is \nunusual among the GNs in not requiring a biopsy if there is a characteristic history and \npositive serology.\nThe key to diagnosis is an association with infection. The best initial test is the antistreptolysin \n(ASO)  or antihyaluronic acid (AHT) .\n• Complement levels, particularly C3, are low.\n• Renal biopsy is rarely needed, but if done would show epithelial “humps” on electron \nmicroscopy. IgG and C3 will be deposited in the mesangium.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   297 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

Antibiotics will eradicate the organism from the pharynx. Gluco -\ncorticoids are sometimes used for unusual persistence of proteinuria or renal failure in adults.\nGoodpasture syndrome  (GPS) is an idiopathic renal and lung disease  characterized by a \nunique anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody. Presentation includes  hematuria and \nhemoptysis . Aside from the lungs and kidneys, GPS does not affect other sites in the body, \nthus an  absence of skin or eye findings  is a clue to the diagnosis. When there is lung involve-\nment (65%), patients present with hemoptysis, cough, and/or shortness of breath.\nThe key to diagnosis is nephritic-pulmonary syndrome.

Cyclophosphamide may also help.\nIgA nephropathy  and Henoch-Schönlein purpura  (HSP) have a common pathophysiology \nand renal presentation, but differ in that HSP also shows signs of systemic vasculitis.\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is most commonly seen in Asian or native Americans age <35. It has \n2 possible presentations:\n• Mild or gross hematuria appearing 1–2 days after a upper respiratory infection  \n(most common on board exams ); resolves spontaneously in 30% of patients. (Com -\npare this to poststreptococcal GN, where renal involvement occurs 1–2 weeks later or \nlonger after a sore throat.)\n• Hematuria and non-nephrotic proteinuria without infectious precedent which \ngradually progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (more insidious form)\nHypertension is common, as in most GN. About 40–50% of IgAN patients progress to ESRD. \nRenal biopsy shows proliferation with IgA deposits.\nHSP has a similar presentation and biopsy, but also shows a skin rash or other vasculitic \nsymptoms. Keys to diagnosis include hematuria, 1–2 day association with URI (for IgAN), and \nvasculitic rash, hematuria (for HSP).\nManagement.  Renal biopsy is required if renal failure or proteinuria present. In HSP , skin \nbiopsy is best Treatment: no proven treatment. In the presence of proteinuria, give ACE \ninhibitors/ARB. If nephrotic, try glucocorticoids.\nLupus nephritis  is a constellation of glomerular diseases associated with SLE. There may be \nasymptomatic proteinuria or hematuria, nephrotic syndrome (secondary membranous GN) or \nthere may be severe nephritic syndrome with progressive renal failure eventually requiring \ndialysis. There are almost always other SLE signs or symptoms present, although a few patients \npresent with renal signs only. Biopsy is key to planning therapy and prognosis.\nKey to diagnosis: nephritic or nephrotic syndrome with SLE diagnostic criteria; best test is \ndouble-stranded DNA levels  and low complement levels during disease flares.

Over \n50% of nephrotic syndrome is associated with a systemic disease, esp. DM.\nProteinuria arises because the damaged glomerular basement membrane loses its negative \ncharges; negatively charged albumin and key serum proteins then spill into the urine. This \nmay lead to hypoalbuminemia and low serum oncotic pressure. Complications of the \nnephrotic syndrome include:\n• Edema due to increased salt and water retention by the kidney, as well as low oncotic \npressure in the serum.\n• Hyperlipidemia and increased atherosclerosis, most likely from the urinary loss of the \nlipoprotein markers or signals on the surface of chylomicrons and LDL that lead to the \nclearance of these lipids from the bloodstream.\n• Hypercoagulable states or thrombophilia, due to the urinary loss of natural antico -\nagulant proteins such as antithrombin, protein C, and protein S.\n• Spontaneous arterial or venous thrombosis due to hypercoagulability.\n• Iron, copper, and zinc deficiency may be present as a result of the urinary loss of their \ntransport proteins such as transferrin and ceruloplasmin.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   299 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

(In \nsome parts of Asia, IgA nephropathy is an equally common cause.) \nComplications\nMost complications of ESRD do not occur until GFR <20–30% of normal (25 mL/minute).  \nA few complications (altered mental state, acidosis, hyperkalemia) are only seen when GFR <10%.\n• Metabolic acidosis  due to retained acids not filtered from the blood by the failing \nkidney. The anion gap is elevated. Treatment is dialysis.\n• Hyperkalemia  due to retained potassium not filtered by the failing kidney. This is a \ncommon cause of death in dialysis patients. Treatment is a low K diet and dialysis. \nLoop diuretics and GI binding agents (e.g. kayexalate) may be used prior to dialysis.\n• Hypermagnesemia . Magnesium accumulates because the falling GFR decreases renal \nexcretion. Treatment is restriction of magnesium intake, e.g. avoidance of milk of \nmagnesia.\n• Hypocalcemia  due to the loss of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D production and from \nhyperphosphatemia (inability of the kidney to excrete phosphate). High phosphate \nlevels contribute to low calcium levels by precipitating out in tissues in combination \nwith the calcium. Treatment is reduction of phosphate and increase of calcium.\n –Hyperphosphatemia is treated with phosphate binders, such as calcium carbonate \nor calcium acetate. Aluminum-containing phosphate binders should not be used, as \naluminum is associated with CNS accumulation, dementia, and bone abnormalities. \nSevelamer and lanthanum are phosphate binders that do not contain aluminum or \ncalcium. Use when calcium is abnormally high due to vitamin D replacement.\n –Hypocalcemia is treated with 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D replacement.\n –Cinacalcet is a substance which simulates the effect of calcium on the parathyroid; \nit will tell the parathyroid to shut off parathyroid hormone production, thus \nhelping to decrease phosphate. Use in severe, refractory cases.\n• Renal osteodystrophy  (osteitis fibrosa cystica). Bone abnormalities occur because \nchronic hypocalcemia leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism , which removes \ncalcium from the bones. In addition, bones buffer the chronic acidosis ESRD by \nremoving calcium from bone. Patients present with bone pain and fractures. Renal \nosteodystrophy is controlled with improving calcium and phosphorous levels and with \ncinacalcet. Parathyroidectomy may be needed for severe hyperparathyroidism that \ndoes not respond to medications.\n• Mental state changes:  a variety of cognitive and mood changes occur with uremia, \nnormally only with severe CKD (GFR <10). The only treatment is dialysis.\n• Anemia  from the loss of production of erythropoietin from the kidney. The anemia is \nnormochromic and normocytic. The anemia is treated with erythropoietin replace -\nment, and iron replacement is often necessary when starting erythropoietin due to \nchronic losses from blood draws, dialysis, and malnutrition.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   304 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_312": "305\nChapter 8   ●  Nephrology\n• Bleeding . The coagulopathy in ESRD arises from uremia-induced platelet dysfunc -\ntion, which prolongs the bleeding time. Treatment is desmopressin, which releases \nsubendothelial stores of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, which increase platelet \naggregation and adherence. A secondary cause in patients still making urine is \nnephrotic-syndrome associated loss of clotting factors in the urine.\n• Hypertension and accelerated atherosclerosis . CKD leads to rapidly progressive \ncoronary artery disease, which is the most common cause of death for those on \ndialysis. The reason for this is not clear. Treatment is good BP control (usually \nmultiple medications and thorough dialysis) and statins for hyperlipidemia.\n• Pericarditis : caused by unknown uremic toxins; may or may not be an associated \neffusion. Requires urgent hemodialysis.\n• Infection . ESRD patients are at increased risk of infection because neutrophils and other \nwhite cells do not work normally in a uremic environment. This is the second most \ncommon cause of death in dialysis patients. Vascular access infections (hemodialysis) \nand peritonitis (peritoneal dialysis) are common. The most common organism is \nStaphylococcus due to the frequent skin punctures required in dialysis.\nTreatment\nCKD is initially treated conservatively to minimize symptoms. However, when conservative \nmanagement fails, renal replacement therapy is required. This can either be dialysis  or renal \ntransplantation .\nMedical management  of CKD includes restriction of fluids, potassium, sodium, protein, \nmagnesium, and phosphate in the diet. Protein restriction is of no value  and may be harmful. \nCommon medications include erythropoietin, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, phosphate binders, \nmultiple anti-hypertensives, and furosemide (if patient still makes urine). Taking so many \nmedications is very difficult for patients who often lack energy or who are confused.\nDialysis  is used in patients with GFR <20%. (It is covered under Medicaid for all patients in \nthe United States.) Dialysis options are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\nAcute indications for dialysis are life-threatening abnormalities that require hospitalization:\n• Pulmonary edema refractory to diuretics\n• Hyperkalemia resistant to therapy\n• Metabolic acidosis\n• Pericarditis\n• Altered mental state\nChronic indications for dialysis (usually initiated from the outpatient setting) include:\n• Severe neuropathy such as myoclonus, wrist/foot drop\n• Persistent nausea and vomiting\n• Weight loss/malnutrition\n• Bleeding diathesis\n• Severe itching\n• Fatigue not correctable with anemia correction\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   305 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

All stones form more readily in concentrated urine, so volume deple -\ntion may precipitate them. There are genetic predispositions to stone formation, sometimes \nlinked to lack of stone-inhibiting proteins in the urine (e.g., nephropontin). Types of stones \ninclude:\n• Calcium oxalate (70%) and calcium phosphate (10%)\n• Struvite/infection (Mg/aluminum/phosphate) (5–10%)\n• Uric acid (5%)\n• Cystine (1%)\n• Indinavir\nCalcium Stones\nCalcium stones (80% of all stones) have several risk factors:\n• Hypercalciuria\n –Idiopathic renal hypercalciuria (normal serum calcium)\n –Resorptive from bone: hyperparathyroidism (10–30% of patients present with \nstones); multiple myeloma, metastatic disease to bone, hypercalcemia of malig -\nnancy (serum calcium high)\n –Increased GI calcium absorption: vitamin D intoxication; increased vitamin D with \nsarcoid and other granulomatous disease; familial (serum calcium high)\n• Hyperoxaluria\n –Primary familial oxaluria\n –Enteric: with fat malabsorption as in Crohn’s disease, the fat binds to calcium, \nleaving unbound oxalate to be reabsorbed in increased amounts, then excreted into \nthe urine.\n• Hypocitraturia\n –Urine citrate is a stone inhibitor, binding with calcium. Patients with low urinary \ncitrate have a higher risk for calcium stones. Patients with type 1 (distal) renal \ntubular acidosis often have hypocitraturia.\nStruvite/Infection Stones\nChronic urinary infections with urease-producing organisms such as Proteus , Pseudomonas , \nand Klebsiella  give a highly alkaline urine that leads to struvite (Mg/aluminum/phosphate) \nstones. These often produce large “staghorn” calculi filling the renal pelvis. The urinalysis may \nshow characteristic “coffin lid” crystals.\nUric Acid Stones\nUric acid stones form in an acid environment and are associated with diseases that increase \nserum uric acid levels, such as gout, hematologic malignancies, and Crohn’s disease. Unlike \nother stones, they are radiolucent on x-ray but can be seen on renal ultrasound.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   307 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_315": "308\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nCystine Stones\nCystine stones (least common) are associated with the genetic disorder cystinuria.

There is often associated nausea \nand vomiting, mimicking an acute abdomen or pelvic inflammatory disease. Gross hematuria \nis common. The patient may recall stone fragments in the urine.\nDiagnosis:  best test is a radiologic test; both spiral helical CT scan (no contrast) and renal U/S \nare equally good. Urine testing may show:\n• UA: blood, crystals; WBC, bacteria (infection stones)\n• Electrolytes: high calcium, high oxalate, and/or low citrate (calcium stones); high uric \nacid (urate stones)\n• pH: >8 in infection (struvite) stones, otherwise lower\nPatients should strain their urine to catch a passing stone, which is then sent for analysis (best \ntest for stone type). Serum studies include:\n• Calcium (sometimes high in calcium stones); if elevated, check the parathyroid \nhormone level\n• Uric acid (high in most urate stones)\nThe serum creatinine will only be elevated if there is bilateral obstruction (hydronephrosis) \nwhich would be seen on U/S or CT.\nTreatment . Analgesia, hydration, and bed rest are the mainstays of treatment. Definitive treat -\nment depends on stone size as determined by radiologic study:\n• <5 mm: stones pass spontaneously\n• 5–10 mm: try ureteral dilating agents like tamsulosin\n• 1–2 cm: lithotripsy (extracorporeal or transurethral)\n• >2 cm surgical excision (percutaneous or transureteral)\nRecurrent stones should be treated with increased hydration, especially in warm climates, and \nmay also be treated with medications appropriate to type:\n• Calcium stones: thiazide diuretics (increases urine Ca reabsorption) or citrate if low \nurine citrate\n• Urate stones: allopurinol or febuxostat (lowers serum uric acid levels)\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   308 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

The most common primary disease is \nautosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPCKD), which often leads to ESRD and \ntransplantation or dialysis. Acquired disease is most often seen in dialysis patients as an \nadventitious finding on CT scanning, and requires no further management.\nAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPCKD) is the most common cystic disease \n(prevalence 1:200 to 1:1,000). Presentation ranges from asymptomatic to painful to progressive \nCKD requiring eventual dialysis. Patients are commonly detected in early adulthood during \nevaluation for a urinary tract infection or flank pain, initially confused with stones.\nClinical presentation includes:\n• Flank pain (one or both sides)\n• Hematuria (microscopic or gross)\n• Progressive loss of GFR\n• Recurrent urine infections\n• Hypertension\n• Extra-renal manifestations: hepatic cysts (40–60%); intracranial aneurysm (10–20%); \nmitral valve prolapse (25%), colonic diverticula\nDiagnosis. The best test is renal ultrasound or CT scanning . Many patients are concerned \nabout the risk of rupture of undetected intracranial aneurysms. Without symptoms there is no \nrecommendation to screen ADPCKD patients with cranial CT scanning, but this may be \nindividualized for patient preference. Even if detected, there is no indication for neurosurgical \nintervention without evidence of a bleed.\nTreatment  is management of the complications (UTI, calculi, and hypertension) and prepare \nthe patient for dialysis if renal function declines. There is no specific treatment. Some patients \nrequire nephrectomy for intractable pain.\nSimple Cysts\nSimply renal cysts are very common and usually of no significance. If they are smooth-walled \nwith no debris inside the cyst, they can be managed without further treatment or diagnostic \ntests. If they have irregular walls or debris inside, follow closely with repeat scans to exclude \nmalignancy.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   309 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

Severe hypertension with end-organ damage is termed emergent \nhypertension.\nComplications of uncontrolled hypertension include:\n• Cardiac : increased risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction, left ventricular \nhypertrophy with eventual CHF, aortic aneurysm, and dissection\n• Cerebrovascular : transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke\n• Renal : nephrosclerosis with microscopic hematuria, mild proteinuria, progressive \nelevation of BUN/creatinine, and eventual dialysis. Hypertension worsens the progno -\nsis of most renal diseases.\n• Retinopathy : hemorrhages, exudates, arteriolar narrowing, and papilledema; these \nresult in blurred vision, scotomata, and sometimes blindness\nEssential Hypertension\nEssential hypertension (>95% of all cases of hypertension) is best thought of as a syndrome \nwith many causes, not a single disease. Causes in each patient vary: arterial stiffening, increased \nsodium sensitivity, or increased renin/angiotensin/aldosterone axis activity. This variability \nmeans that each patient will respond differently to a given intervention or medication.\nEpidemiologically, essential hypertension is:\n• More common with increasing age (found in 50% of those age >60)\n• More common in obese patients\n• Men > women until after menopause\n• More common in black population at all ages, as is incidence of end-organ damage\n• Onset usually age 25–55\nClinical Presentation.  The most common presentation of essential hypertension is an \nasymptomatic patient  in whom an elevated BP is found during a routine examination or \nevaluation for other medical problems. Much less commonly when symptoms are associated \nwith hypertension, think of them as follows:\n• Acute symptoms associated with a hypertensive emergency OR\n• Complications from end-organ damage\nWith a hypertensive emergency, signs and symptoms may include evidence of stroke (neuro-\nlogic findings, headache, blurred vision, dizziness) or cardiac symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea)\nDiagnosis.  Hypertension is diagnosed when  systolic BP 140 mm Hg  or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg \n(or both) on repeated examination . Systolic BP is particularly important, and is the basis for \ndiagnosis in most patients. These numbers apply to all adults age >18 (although for those age ≥80, \nsystolic BP up to 150 mm Hg is now regarded as acceptable).\nNew 2017 ACC guidelines have recommended diagnostic values and therapy targets of \n<130/80 mm Hg for patients with DM, elevated calculated cardiac risk (>10%),  or chronic \nkidney disease . These more rigid guidelines are controversial, since “tight” treatment increases \nmedication use and increases the risk of falls, especially in elderly patients.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   310 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

A more intensive workup can be done if there is a high \nclinical suspicion.\nThere are several types of secondary hypertension.\n• Renal artery stenosis  may be unilateral or bilateral, and is caused by atherosclerotic \ndisease in patients with high CV risk or fibromuscular dysplasia in young women. \nPhysical exam may show an upper abdominal bruit  radiating laterally (50–70% of \npatients). Radiologic confirmation tests include:\n –Renal artery duplex U/S  (best screening test)\n –Captopril renogram measures the uptake of a radioisotope before and after the \nadministration of captopril; a positive test is when there is decreased uptake of the \nisotope (i.e., decreased GFR) after giving the captopril (accuracy is diminished with \nrenal insufficiency)\n –Magnetic resonance angiography (equal to sonography in diagnostic ability but \nmore expensive)\n –Renal arteriography (more invasive and used prior to surgical revascularization to \nconfirm the extent of stenosis)\n –Treatment . For bilateral disease , the best initial treatment is percutaneous \ntransluminal angioplasty  with stenting. If stenosis recurs, repeat the procedure.

Treatment emphasizes the use of ACE inhibitors (or ARB) for their effect in \nslowing progression of disease and reducing proteinuria. Once on dialysis, effective \nfluid removal will improve the resistant hypertension seen in these patients.\n• Primary hyperaldosteronism  is caused by a unilateral or bilateral adrenal adenoma \n(most common) or by bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Cancer is rarely the cause. The \nkey features are hypertension in association with hypokalemia.  Diagnose with \nelevated aldosterone level and aldosterone/plasma renin activity in urine and blood. \nTreatment is surgical resection (for those with an adenoma) or potassium sparing \ndiuretics such as spironolactone for those with adrenal hyperplasia. If an adenoma is \nsuspected but not seen on radiologic studies, bilateral renal vein sampling for differen -\ntial aldosterone levels may assist in locating the lesion.\n• Cushing disease  is hypercortisolism, most often due to ACTH hypersecretion by a \npituitary adenoma. The key feature is hypertension in association with characteristic \ncushingoid manifestations such as truncal obesity, buffalo hump, menstrual abnor -\nmalities, striae and impaired healing, etc. Dexamethasone suppression testing, \n24-hour urine cortisol, or salivary cortisol are the best initial tests. Treatment is \nsurgical resection of the adenoma.\n• Pheochromocytoma  (rare) is most often a benign tumor of the adrenal gland.

It is defined \nas a low serum sodium concentration <135 mEq. It is almost always caused by an excess of \nfree water  (some call it “hyper-aquemia”), usually by excessive renal water absorption.\nThe physiologic effects of hyponatremia do not stem from the sodium per se, but rather from \nthe low serum osmolality , which causes cerebral edema. Sodium is the main determinant of \nthe serum osmolality, as about 85–90% of sodium is extracellular. As seen in the below \nformula for calculated osmolality, about 280 mosm/kg of the total serum osmolality of  \n290 mosm/kg comes from sodium.\nSerum osmolality = (2 × sodium ) + BUN/2.8 + glucose/18\n 290 280 5 5\nTherefore, hyponatremia usually = hypo-osmolarity.Note\nFurosemide and other loop \ndiuretics are the most potent \nagents for diuresis (CHF, renal \nfailure), but they lack the \nvasodilating capability of \nthiazides so are not effective \nfor treating essential \nhypertension .\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   316 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_324": "317\nChapter 8   ●  Nephrology\nWhile hyponatremia suggests a disorder of sodium, water is in fact the culprit, and total body \nsodium may be low, high, or normal. Hyponatremia can be classified by the patient’s extracel -\nlular volume status (which equals the total body sodium):\n• Hypovolemic hyponatremia : low extracellular volume (ECV), low total body sodium \n(dehydration, GI loss)\n• Euvolemic hyponatremia : clinically normal ECV, normal total body Na (SIADH, \nthiazides, SSRIs)\n• Hypervolemic hyponatremia : high ECV, high total body Na (cirrhosis, CHF)\nWhile total body Na may be low, normal, or high, in all cases the ratio of total body sodium \nto total body water  is low, therefore causing the hyponatremia.\nClinical Presentation and Diagnosis.  Symptoms of hyponatremia are predominantly neuro-\nlogic, ranging from mild confusion and forgetfulness to disorientation and obtundation to \nseizure (or even coma). Symptoms do not correspond to a specific sodium level because they \nlargely depend on how fast the level dropped (but symptoms are rare >125 mEq/L). An acute \n15–20 point drop in sodium can cause a seizure or coma.\nThe history should focus on symptoms of malignancy, psychiatric, heart, renal, and liver \ndisease. The drug history should ask about SSRI antidepressants, thiazides, and antipsychotics. \nThe physical exam should determine the patient’s extracellular volume status  (especially \northostasis), hypotension, tachycardia, and edema.\nLabs:  In addition to the serum sodium  concentration , the patient may benefit from checking \nserum osmolarity (usually low; if normal-high consider pseudohyponatremia); urine sodium \n(low (<10 mEq/L) in hypo- and hypervolemic types, high (>40) in euvolemic; and urine \nosmolarity (inappropriately high in face of low serum osmolarity, i.e. >200 mosm/kg, often \n>500 in SIADH).\nPseudohyponatremia\nIn pseudohyponatremia, serum sodium is low but serum osmolarity is normal or high. The \npatient appears euvolemic and is asymptomatic. No specific hyponatremia therapy is needed.\nThe  common causes of pseudohyponatremia should be excluded before further work-up is \ndone. These causes include hyperglycemia  (where increased serum osmolarity pulls water out \nof cells, diluting the serum sodium) and hyperlipidemia  (a lab artifact in which the high lipid \nfraction “dilutes” the measured sodium concentration despite a normal true serum value). \nHypovolemic hyponatremia\nIn hypovolemic hyponatremia, hyponatremia develops because of the loss of sodium and water \nthrough body fluids but sodium losses exceed water losses. It may be worsened if pure water is \nused as fluid replacement, rather than balanced electrolyte solutions. For example, when you \nsweat during exercise (loss of hypotonic sodium and water) and replace only with free water, \nserum sodium may drop over time. Causes include GI loss (vomiting, diarrhea, gastric \nsuction), skin loss (burns, sweating, cystic fibrosis), diuretics, and renal sodium loss (salt \nwasting in Addison disease, cerebral salt wasting after neurosurgical procedures).\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   317 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_325": "318\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nPatients show signs of ECV depletion (orthostasis, hypotension, tachycardia, decreased skin \nturgor). Serum Na is usually >125 mEq/L, so hyponatremic symptoms are uncommon. Urine \nsodium concentration will be low (<10 mEq/L) reflecting avid renal Na reabsorption due to \nlow ECV .\nTreatment  is normal saline ( the only time  this is used in hyponatremia).\nHypervolemic hyponatremia\nIn hypervolemic hyponatremia, hyponatremia is caused by high ADH levels, stimulated by a \ndrop in “effective circulating volume” , i.e. organ perfusion, such as in vasodilated states or CHF \nwhere cardiac output drops. The kidney reabsorbs sodium and water in response to the low \nperfusion, but more water is retained than sodium, leading to hyponatremia. Note that while \nNa and water reabsorption are usually linked in normal physiology, Na is controlled by \naldosterone, water by ADH, so the linkage may not be precise in some patients with low \neffective circulating volume. This subset develops hyponatremia. Causes include CHF; \nnephrotic syndrome and low albumin states; and cirrhosis.\nPatients will show signs of ECV expansion: edema, ascites, pulmonary crackles, and specific \nsigns of heart, liver, or renal disease. The serum Na is usually >125 mEq/L, so hyponatremic \nsymptoms are uncommon. Urine sodium concentration will be low (<10 mEq/L) reflecting \navid renal Na reabsorption due to reduced renal perfusion.\nTreatment  is of the underlying disorder. Furosemide may help with urinary dilution, so \nenhance water excretion.\nEuvolemic (normal ECV) hyponatremia\nPatients with euvolemic hyponatremia are hyponatremic—often severely so—yet appear \nneither volume-depleted nor expanded. ADH levels are often very high. These cases often \nrequire specific hyponatremia treatment to avoid neurologic consequences. Causes include:\n• High ADH levels released by the posterior pituitary \n –Psychiatric drugs and diseases (especially SSRI antidepressants, most common \ncause  in United States)\n –Surgery, stress, endurance exercise (“marathon hyponatremia”)\n –Hypocortisolism\n –Hypothyroidism\n• ADH released by other body cells: syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone \nsecretion (SIADH)\n• Excess water intake: psychogenic polydipsia: patients must drink at least 15–20 liters a \nday of fluid to overwhelm the diluting capacity of the kidney\n• Decreased renal water excretion (non-ADH mediated)\n –Thiazide diuretics: inhibit distal tubule Na reabsorption and generation of free \nwater, limiting ability of kidney to excrete very dilute urine\n –Often occurs in patients doing extreme hiking or exercise; patients on thiazides \nneed to eat and/or drink solute solutions during such exerciseNote\nEnd-stage kidney disease also \nmay show hypervolemic \nhyponatremia, but from a \ndifferent mechanism. Here, \nthe failing kidney stops \nfiltering water, yet the patient \ncontinues to drink it, leading \nto hyponatremia. This is often \nseen in patients prior to \ndialysis.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   318 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_326": "319\nChapter 8   ●  Nephrology\nDiagnosis : Patients will show normal clinical volume status. While there is total body water \nexpansion, water is an ineffective clinical volume expander, so no edema results. Serum Na \nvaries, but may be very low (<110), so hyponatremic symptoms are common . Urine sodium \nconcentration will be >40 mEq/L) reflecting the kidney’s sensing of mild volume expansion \nfrom water retention, resulting in sodium diuresis, thus worsening the problem (water reten -\ntion, sodium excretion). This explains the increased severity of hyponatremia in some patients. \nUrine osmolarity is often >500 mosm/kg, so administered fluids need to be more concentrated \nthan that (i.e. avoid normal saline whose osmolarity is 300). Other lab workup includes:\n• Serum uric acid (low in euvolemic hyponatremia due to increased urine loss of UA)\n• Serum ADH level: this is the single most accurate test, but is rarely done due to time \nand expense. Levels are high.\n• Thyroid function (TSH) to rule out hypothyroidism\n• Serum cortisol and/or ACTH stimulation test (rule out hypocortisolism)\nTreatment.  In general, patients should limit water intake since water will worsen any other \ncause. Conversely, solute intake should be increased. Marathon runners and endurance athletes \nshould drink electrolyte beverages (not pure water) and eat regularly. Normal saline should be \navoided since patients with this condition will absorb the water and dump the sodium, often \nworsening the hyponatremia. Medications suspected as causative should be stopped.\n• For symptomatic hyponatremia  (usually serum Na <120 mEq/L), administer hyp er-\ntonic (3%) saline infusion (high sodium content, osmolality of 1000, much greater \nthan what is exiting in the urine) and consider furosemide (helps dilute urine in \neuvolemic hyponatremia). Stop acute treatment when the patient becomes asymptom -\natic (usually when Na >120 mEq/L). Monitor the rate of rise of sodium so as not  \nto cause central demyelinating syndrome , which occurs if sodium is corrected  \ntoo rapidly or is overcorrected. Generally, the rate of rise should not exceed  \n0.5–1 mEq per hour; this means no more than a 12-point rise in 12–24-hours.\n• For moderate asymptomatic hyponatremia  (usually serum Na >120), increase serum \nNa slowly. Educate the patient about limiting water intake . Also consider ADH \nantagonists (tolvaptan, conivaptan); demeclocycline (mild ADH antagonist); urea or \nsalt tablets (increase solute without water); or fludrocortisone (used for cerebral \nsalt-wasting after neurosurgery).\nHypernatremia\nHypernatremia is the “flip side” of hyponatremia, and is caused by free water deficiency . This \nmay be due to non-renal losses (GI, sweating) or to diabetes insipidus, in which lack of ADH \n(or resistance to it) causes persistent polyuria and loss of free water.\nA crucial element in developing hypernatremia is the lack of water intake , usually due to \ntrauma, environmental causes (lost in the desert), or mental status changes. Another common \ncause is patients with diabetes insipidus who are placed NPO in the hospital for surgery and \ncannot drink their usual liters of water per day.\nNon-renal water loss  is the most common class of hypernatremia, and increases in summer \nmonths when temperatures rise. Patients have low urine output and concentrated urine. \nCauses include:\n• Insensible losses: sweating, burns, fever, exercise, or respiratory infections\n• GI loss: osmotic diarrhea (e.g., lactulose, malabsorption), some infectious diarrheaNote\nHyponatremia can be \ncorrected as rapidly as 2 mEq \nper hour if the patient is \nseizing.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   319 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

Symptoms are primarily neurologic. With severe \nhypernatremia of any cause, lethargy, weakness, irritability, seizures, and coma are present. \nThere should be a history of limited water access (e.g. loss of consciousness, confusion, falls, \nlack of water access), since patients with the above diseases will normally drink enough water \nto keep their serum sodium normal.\nThe physical exam usually demonstrates signs of volume depletion (orthostasis, tachycardia), \nsince water and salt are both lost. Urine output is <1 liter per day in insensible water loss, while \n3–20 liters per day in diabetes insipidus.\nLab evaluation will show high serum Na, low urine Na (<10 mEq/L)\n• In diabetes insipidus, the urine osmolality will often be <100 mosm/kg, reflecting the \ndilute urine\n• To differentiate central from nephrogenic DI , administer ADH (nasal, IV). The \nurine osmolality will increase in central DI, but not in nephrogenic DI.\nTreatment . Stop or reduce the lithium or other implicated medication. If patients are alert, \nthey can drink water. If patients are hypovolemic (tachycardia, orthostasis), first administer \nnormal saline and then switch to hypotonic saline (0.45% saline or 5% dextrose in water). \nOnce they become alert, switch to oral fluids.\n• Correction of sodium should be  <1 mEq/L every 2 hours  or 12 mEq/L per day . \nComplications of overly rapid correction include cerebral edema and seizures, possibly \ncausing permanent neurologic damage. A rate of correction as fast as 2 mEq per hour \nis acceptable only if the patient is seizing.\n• In central DI also use vasopressin  (ADH) subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscu -\nlarly, or by nasal spray. Central DI is usually transient, esp. post operatively\n• In nephrogenic DI , reduce or stop the causative drug. For chronic DI, thiazides may \nbe useful (recall that they cause  hyponatremia but treat  hypernatremia). NSAIDs may \nalso help, as they inhibit prostaglandins which impair concentrating ability; NSAIDs \nwill increase the action of ADH at the kidney.\nHypokalemia\nHypokalemia (serum potassium [<3.5 mEq/L) is relatively common, especially in patients \ntaking diuretics or with poor PO intake. Dietary potassium is high in fruits and meats. \nExcretion is by renal (controlled by aldosterone) and GI routes.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   320 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

Too-rapid IV repletion may cause a  \nfatal arrhythmia .\nVery large amounts of potassium may be necessary to raise the body potassium level by even 1 \nor 2 points.

It is potentially lethal, and requires prompt treatment and good prevention. \nPatients at risk should avoid bananas, citrus, and other high-K foods. Causes include:\n• Increased intake (orally or by IV): usually in the presence of impaired excretion\n• Shift of K out of cells into ECF:\n –Pseudohyperkalemia (a lab artifact): secondary hemolysis due to mechanical RBC \ntrauma during venipuncture (look for “hemolyzed” specimen)\n –Excessive thrombocytopenia >1,000,000, leukemia (WBCs >100,000)\n –Damaged cells: rhabdomyolysis, seizures, extreme exercise,\n –Metabolic acidosis: H+ moves into cells, K+ moves out; for every 0.1-point decrease \nin the pH, potassium level will increase by 0.7Note\nHyperaldosteronism can be \ncaused by adrenal adenomas \n(low renin and AT), bilateral \nadrenal hyperplasia (low renin \nand AT), or renal artery \nstenosis (high renin and AT). \nHyperaldosteronism causes \nsecondary hypertension, \nhypokalemia, and metabolic \nalkalosis.\nNote\nA U-wave is an extra wave \nafter the T-wave that is \nindicative of Purkinje fiber \nrepolarization.\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   321 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

They have consequences and sequelae based on changes to \nthe body pH, but also are very useful diagnostically as clues to other diseases.\n• Acidemia  and alkalemia  are reduced and increased blood pH, due to ≥1 causes\n• Acidosis  and alkalosis  are specific pathologic processes (≥1) that cause the net \nchange.\n• A mixed acid-base disorder  means having ≥2 acidoses/alkaloses, e.g., an anion gap \nmetabolic acidosis with a respiratory alkalosis (as in aspirin toxicity).\n• A compensation  is not a disorder; it is the body’s normal response to a change in pH \ncaused by an alkalosis or acidosis. For example, during a metabolic acidosis (e.g., \nDKA), the acidemic pH is sensed by the CNS, which induces pulmonary hyperventila -\ntion (the respiratory compensation), lowering the pCO2 and raising the pH back \ntoward normal. Each acid base disorder has an expected compensation.\nMetabolic Acidosis\nMetabolic acidosis is a decrease in blood pH [<7.35] caused by either endogenous or exog-\nenous acids accumulating in the blood. It often accompanies serious illness (e.g. lactic acidosis \nin sepsis).\nThe pattern seen on the arterial blood gas is:\npH pCO2HCO3−\n↓ ↓ ↓\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   323 16/05/19   11:07 AM",
    "page_331": "324\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nThe low bicarbonate reflects the increased serum protons, which lowers the pH. The pCO2 \nthen falls as a respiratory compensation , as the CNS senses the acidosis and stimulates \nhyperventilation, which raises the pH back toward normal. Note that this reduction in pCO2 is \nnot a “respiratory alkalosis”  (which would suggest an actual respiratory disorder, not a \ncompensation as seen here).\nThe expected compensation for a given level of HCO3 in metabolic acidosis can be predicted \nfrom Winters Formula:\nExpected PaCO2 = (1.5 × serum HCO3) + 8 mm Hg (± 2)\nIf the observed pCO2 is too high or too low compared to this calculated value, a second \nacid-base disturbance is present (see Mixed Acid Base Disorders).\nFormulas such as these become less accurate at extremes of pH. For these, use an acid base \nnomogram.\nThe anion gap  should be calculated once the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis is established so \nthat we can categorize metabolic acidoses into high anion gap or normal anion gap types. The \nanion gap  is an estimate of the unmeasured anions present in the bloodstream. The blood is \nelectrically neutral, with a mix of anions and cations which include minerals (Na+, H+, Ca++, \nHCO3−) and proteins (albumin (negative charge), immunoglobulins (positive charge). Rather \nthan measure them all, the anion gap is used to estimate the net charge due to abnormal \nanions or cations that may be present in the blood.\nAnion gap = (Na+) − (HCO3− + Cl−)\n(normal 8–12)\nThe normal anion gap of 8–12 means that in normal subjects, all the anions, cations, and \nproteins that are not Na+, HCO3−, or Cl−, add up to a net negative 8–12 mEq/L. When this \nnumber increases (becomes more negative), it indicates an “anion gap, ” caused by excess \nanions that are not normally present in the blood . These may be exogenous (e.g. oxalic from \nantifreeze) or endogenous (lactic from sepsis).\nTherefore, when there is an elevated anion gap, assume that a high anion gap acidosis  is \npresent. If instead the patient has a metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap, a normal \nanion gap metabolic acidosis  is present.\nClinical Presentation and Treatment.  Patients with metabolic acidosis will have symptoms \nrelated to the underlying cause. Acidemia per se does not cause symptoms until very severe \n(<7.1), when it may cause arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output. Treatment varies by \ncause, and usually includes some combination of removing the excess acid and administration \nof bicarbonate.\nHigh anion gap metabolic acidosis\nThis is a metabolic acidosis caused by excess acid present in the blood, which may be endog-\nenous or exogenous (ingested). The main causes are summarized below (note that many of \nthese cause lactic acidosis, which can be measured in routine lab testing).\nUse the mnemonic  MUDPILES :\n• Methanol, metformin (cause formic acidosis and lactic acidosis, respectively)\n• Uremia (GFR <10% of normal)An alternative shortcut \n(but less accurate) is that \nin metabolic acidosis the \nexpected PaCO2 is \napproximately equal to \nthe last 2 digits of the \npH ± 2.\nNote\nThe anion gap may become \nabnormally low without acid-\nbase abnormalities due to \nexcess blood cations or \ndeficient anions:\n• Hypoalbuminemia \n(cirrhosis, nephrotic \nsyndrome)\n• Multiple myeloma (excess \npositive light chains)\n• Lithium (excess cations)\n08_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch08.indd   324 16/05/19   11:07 AM",

Serum K is low. Urine pH \nis appropriately low (<5.3) for any acidosis, unless the patient has just ingested bicarbonate, in \nwhich case the transient bicarbonate diuresis will raise the urine pH.\nTo confirm diagnosis, show that bicarbonaturia develops with bicarbonate administration, \neven when the patient is acidotic. Normal subjects do not excrete bicarbonate in the urine \nuntil their serum bicarbonate >24.\nTreatment  is bicarbonate (large amounts), potassium, and thiazide diuretics.\nDistal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis\nThis may be an isolated inability of the proximal tubule to reclaim bicarbonate, or \n accompanied by global proximal tubule dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome)--the latter would \nalso show glucosuria, phosphaturia, uric acid, and aminoaciduria. The loss of bicarbonate \nleads to the non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Patients may develop osteomalacia. Causes \ninclude multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, and genetic disorders such as cystinosis and \n galactosemia.\nDiagnosis.  Serum HCO3 may drop to low levels (<15). Serum K is usually low but can vary. \nUrine pH is inappropriately high (>5.5) for acidosis, due to the lack of free protons secreted \ninto the tubule.

An example is \naspirin toxicity, where there is a combined respiratory alkalosis and high anion gap metabolic \nacidosis. The net pH may be normal in the face of abnormal pCO2 and bicarbonate, as shown \nby these values: blood: pH 7.41, pCO2 25 mm Hg, HCO3 16 mEq/L.\nDiagnosis.  There are several clues to help identify a mixed acid-based disorder:\n• Clue 1 : If there are large changes in pCO2 and HCO3 but a near-normal pH, there is a \nmixed disorder (as shown in the aspirin toxicity example above).\n• Clue 2 : In all single disorders , the  pCO2 and HCO3 “move together ,” both either go \nup or down. If they go in different directions or if one is normal, suspect a mixed \ndisorder.\n –Suppose the values from a patient after cardiac arrest are blood pH 7.15, pCO2  \n60 mm Hg, and HCO3 20 mEq/L. The pCO2 is elevated while the bicarbonate is \ndepressed, which violates the “move together” rule.\n –Therefore, the patient has a combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis, typical  \nof those who have had a cardiac arrest.

The Winter’s Formula (for metabolic acidosis compensation) is an \nexample:\nExpected PaCO2 = (1.5 × serum HCO3) + 8 mm Hg ( ± 2)\nSuppose the values from a septic patient are blood pH 7.10, pCO2 35 mm Hg, and HCO3  \n10 mEq/L. Using clues 1 and 2 would still support a single disorder (metabolic acidosis).\nHowever, when the Winter’s Formula is applied, we see that the predicted pCO2 in a compen-\nsated simple metabolic acidosis should be (1.5 × 10) + 8 = 23 mm Hg, which diverges from the \nmeasured value of 35. This patient has a higher than expected pCO2 and thus a combined \nmetabolic and respiratory acidosis. This double disorder results in a very acidemic pH.\nEach of the single acid base disorders has a compensation formula similar to Winter’s for \nmetabolic acidosis.

The shape of the loop \ncan characterize the type and distribution of airway obstruction. \n• When comparing a normal flow volume loop with one of restrictive lung disease, the \n restrictive lung disease alters the size of the loop (a shift to the right of the x-axis), \nwhich is related to a reduction in lung volumes. \n• On the other hand, obstructive lung disease alters the shape of the loop by causing a \nreduction of airflow (alterations on the y-axis).\n• In the case of a fixed airway-obstruction (tracheal stenosis after prolonged intubation), \nthe flow volume loop is flattened on the top and bottom. \n• With dynamic extrathoracic airway obstruction (vocal cord paralysis), the obstruction \n occurs mostly with inspiration while expiration is mostly normal.

We can calculate \nDo2 from the following equation:\nDo2 = Cardiac Output × (1.34 × Hb × HbSat) + 0.0031 + Pao2\nwhere Do2 is oxygen delivery, HbSat is hemoglobin saturation, and Pao2 is partial pressure of \noxygen in the blood (oxygen dissolved in plasma).\nNotice that the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues accounted for by the Pao2 (oxygen \ndissolved in blood) is minimal. The most important factors in the delivery of oxygen to the \nvital organs are the cardiac output  and hemoglobin .\nIn a critically ill patient, it is most important (the next step) to keep the hemoglobin and \ncardiac output near normal. There will be minimal change in Do2 if you increase the Pao2 from \n60 to 100 mm Hg by giving the patient 100% oxygen.\nThe alveolar–arterial gradient  (PAo2–Pao2 gradient) is useful in the assessment of oxygen-\nation and is calculated by the following formula:Clinical Pearl\nFEO may occur in the setting \nof a tracheal tumor or foreign \nobject aspiration or tracheal \nstenosis after prolonged \nintubation.\nDo not memorize this formula, \njust know the concept.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   336 16/05/19   11:09 AM",

This gradient is  \n5–15 mm Hg in normal young patients. It increases with all causes of hypoxemia except \nhypoventilation and high altitude. The gradient also increases with age.\nIn the clinical setting, a patient who has overdosed from opiates (and has decreased respiratory \nrate) would have severe hypoxemia but a normal gradient. \nCHEST RADIOGRAPHY\nChest radiography is often the initial diagnostic study performed to evaluate patients with \nrespiratory symptoms.

He has never smoked \nand otherwise feels well. The physical examination is unremarkable. What will you \nrecommend for this patient?\nThe solitary pulmonary nodule that is found incidentally on an x-ray poses a specific  problem \nfor the clinician. Around 35% of all solitary nodules are malignant.\nCalcification of the nodule points toward a benign diagnosis, e.g., popcorn calcifications \nusually are caused by hamartomas, whereas bull’s-eye calcifications are caused by granulomas.\nThe first step  is to look for a prior x-ray . Finding the same pulmonary nodule on an x-ray \ndone years ago may save you from doing any further workup. If no prior x-ray is available, \nthen consider whether this patient is high or low risk for lung cancer.\n• In low-risk patients , age <35 and nonsmokers with calcified nodules, follow the \npatient with chest x-ray or chest CT every 3 months for 2 years. Stop the follow-up if \nafter 2 years there is no growth.\n• High-risk patients  age >50 with a smoking history and a nodule are likely to have \nbronchogenic cancer. The best diagnostic procedure is to biopsy (or possibly resect) \nthe nodule. Bronchoscopy will not reach peripheral lesions and will mislabel 10% of \ncentral cancers by finding only nonspecific inflammatory changes. Bronchoscopy is \nperformed blindly and the specimen obtained can be limited, hence the nonspecific \nfindings (inflammation, etc.). If you suspect cancer in a patient and the bronchos -\ncopy returns with a negative result, open lung biopsy and lung nodule resection must \nbe considered. For peripheral nodules, consider CT-guided biopsy, VATS, or open \nlung biopsy and nodule removal. PET-CT has not so far been well studied in the \nevaluation of high-risk patients with lung nodules.\nPleural Effusion\nA 67-year-old man presents with complaints of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain \nthat has worsened over the past month. He has also noticed weight loss of \n20 pounds and low-grade fever over this time period. On physical examination \nhis respiratory rate is 24/min, and you find decreased air entry in the right lower \nlobe with dullness to percussion. Chest x-ray shows a pleural effusion involving \nabout one-third of the lung field. A decubitus x-ray shows layering of the fluid.\nPleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity. It is either transudative or \nexudative.\nTransudative effusion  is caused by systemic factors: either increased hydrostatic pressure (e.g., \nCHF) or decreased oncotic pressure (e.g., nephrotic syndrome or cirrhosis). Because these \ndiseases are systemic, they usually cause bilateral and equal effusion.\nA transudative effusion needs no further evaluation. It resolves by adequate treatment of the \nprimary disease.Clinical Pearl\nIn all patients with a \npulmonary nodule, first try to \nobtain an old chest x-ray.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   338 16/05/19   11:09 AM",

It is reasonable to observe pleural effusion when \nthere is overt CHF (especially if bilateral), viral pleurisy, or recent thoracic or  abdominal \nsurgery.

A thoracocentesis is mandatory also \nin this setting to rule out a complicated parapneumonic effusion (because of the possibility of \nprogression to an empyema). An empyema (or complicated effusion) needs chest-tube drainage \nto resolve, while an uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion responds to antibiotics alone.\nThe most common causes of malignant pleural effusion are lung cancer, breast cancer, and \nlymphoma. When considering a malignant pleural effusion, make sure to send the thoracocen-\ntesis fluid for cytologic examination.  \nHemorrhagic pleural effusion may be seen in mesothelioma, metastatic lung or breast  cancer, \npulmonary thromboembolism (with infarction), and trauma.\nIn patients with lymphocytic predominant exudative pleural effusions, consider tuberculosis. \nThe pleural effusion is thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction to the tuberculosis \nmycobacterium and its antigens. The adenosine deaminase is elevated, and the polymerase \nchain reaction (PCR) for tuberculous DNA is positive. The acid-fast stain and culture for \ntuberculosis are positive in <30% of the cases. A pleural biopsy confirms the diagnosis and is \nthe most sensitive and specific test for pleural tuberculosis.\nAlways perform thoracocentesis under the guidance of ultrasonography. If ultrasonography is \nnot available, then perform a decubitus chest x-ray before the thoracocentesis. If the decubitus \nchest x-ray detects 1 cm or more of free-flowing fluid , the thoracocentesis can be performed \nwith a minimal risk of complications. If the decubitus detects non-free fluid (loculated), it \nwould be safer to perform an U/S-guided thoracocentesis.\nWikipedia, James Heilman, MD\nFigure 9-7. Pleural Effusion\nEvaluating patients with acute respiratory compromise and distress\nRespiratory compromise may result from airway obstruction (asthma, COPD, foreign  object), \nbut it also accompanies parenchymal lung disease (bacterial or viral pneumonia, lung injury), \nheart failure, pulmonary embolism, neurogenic processes (respiratory depression from \nopiates), and neuromuscular disease (myasthenia gravis). \n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   340 16/05/19   11:09 AM",
    "page_348": "Chapter 9   ●  Pulmonology\n341\nRespiratory distress is usually the presenting complaint or sign. Complaints of shortness of \nbreath or signs of tachypnea or labored breathing are the most common. The patient may also \ndevelop neurologic symptoms: agitation, confusion, and a depressed level of consciousness. \nStridor indicates upper airway obstruction.\nThe physician’s first task is to ensure that the patient’s airway is patent and that breathing is \nadequate. Supplemental oxygen should be provided immediately to ensure adequate oxygen \nsaturation. The resources to perform endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation should \nbe made available.\nThe history should focus on the quickness of onset, as well as associated symptoms (cough, \nfever, etc.). Acute presentations accompanied by cough, fever, and sputum production suggest \nan infectious etiology. Sudden onset of dyspnea without systemic symptoms should raise the \npossibility of airway obstruction, cardiac disease, or thromboembolic disease. Chronic and \nprogressive dyspnea (with or without recent exacerbation) is usually associated with a chronic \npulmonary process, like interstitial lung disease or COPD.\nThe physical examination should focus on finding the cause, as well as assessing the degree of \nrespiratory compromise. A respiratory rate >30/min in an adult suggests severe respiratory \ncompromise. Wheezing on auscultation accompanies asthma and COPD. Localized wheezing \nusually suggests a foreign object or mass. Rales on examination may accompany pneumonia, \ninterstitial lung disease, or heart failure. Consolidative changes may accompany pneumonia or \natelectasis. Normal lung examination may be seen in thromboembolic disease, infections like \nPneumocystis carinii , and disorders of the central respiratory drive.\nAn arterial blood-gas (ABG) measurement is the most important initial laboratory test in \ndetermining the presence and severity of respiratory compromise.  \nThe hallmark  of acute respiratory failure is a rise in P CO2 accompanied by a drop in pH. The \nbicarbonate level will initially be normal, but will increase over 24–48 hours with the appropri-\nate renal compensation. Hypercapnia may accompany hypoxemia or may be  absent if ventila-\ntion is adequate. The presence of metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis) in the presence of \nhypercapnia should prompt the consideration of mechanical ventilation.\nIn the setting of acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, the administration of supplemental \noxygen is often associated with a rise in Pa CO2. Although attributed to a decreased respiratory \ndrive, the pathophysiology of this is more complex. For the clinician, fear of a rising Pa CO2 \nshould never  preclude the administration of enough supplemental oxygen to ensure adequate \noxygen delivery. The target range of 88–92% oxygen saturation usually allows for adequate \noxygen delivery while minimizing the potential increase in Pa CO2.\nOther diagnostic tests\n• B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP)  appears useful as an adjunct to clinical assessment \nin determining the cause of acute dyspnea in patients presenting emergently. An \nelevated BNP is seen in almost all patients with left heart failure. It is important to \nremember that cor pulmonale and acute right ventricular failure (thromboembolism) \nmay also cause a rise in the BNP. Thus, although the BNP is a very sensitive test for \nheart failure, it is not specific.\n• The chest x-ray  is particularly helpful in determining the cause of respiratory failure. A \nchest x-ray without parenchymal infiltrates accompanies respiratory failure due to \nthromboembolism, central respiratory depression, neuromuscular disease, and upper \nairway obstruction. Airway obstruction that accompanies asthma and COPD is usually \n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   341 16/05/19   11:09 AM",

The \nchest x-ray is diagnostic in cases of respiratory compromise caused by large pleural \neffusions or tension pneumothorax. Focal infiltrates suggest bacterial, viral, or fungal \npneumonia; aspiration; or pulmonary hemorrhage. Unusual causes of localized infil -\ntrates may be Churg-Strauss or Wegener granulomatosis. Heart failure and ARDS \npresent with a diffuse edema pattern.\nTreatment.  New, persistent hypoxemia is generally an indication for admission to the  hospital. \nThe need for mechanical ventilation and close monitoring of a patient with respiratory compro -\nmise is an indication for admission to the ICU. Also, ICU admission should be considered for \nall patients with increasing oxygen demands, as well as those requiring continuous nursing.\nThe presence of respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia in a patient presenting with asthma \nexacerbation is an ominous sign and should prompt consideration for intubation and \n mechanical ventilation. Indications for intubation (with or without ventilation) also include \nupper-airway injury (burns, laryngeal edema, trauma) and airway compromise, often in the \nsetting of neurologic depression with loss of protective reflexes, including gag and cough.\nAcute respiratory failure which presents during hospitalization  deserves a specific mention. The \n immobility which accompanies the hospitalized patient puts him at significant risk for pulmonary \nthromboembolic disease, so that should be considered in any patient who develops  dyspnea, tachy -\npnea, and/or hypoxemia. Inpatients are also at risk for developing aspiration, which may precipi -\ntate respiratory failure directly or through the development of pneumonia or acute  respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). The risk factors for aspiration include impaired consciousness and \nupper airway instrumentation (nasogastric tubes). Iatrogenic causes must also be considered, \nespecially respiratory depression from opiates causing respiratory arrest. \nARDS is a frequent cause of respiratory failure in patients suffering from other serious \nillnesses. ARDS represents a diffuse inflammatory response of the lung and develops within \n24–72 hours of the onset of illness or injury. The clinical presentation is increasing respiratory \ndistress with tachypnea and hypoxemia. The chest x-ray reveals diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, \nconsistent with pulmonary edema (noncardiogenic pulmonary edema).\nClinical Recall\nWhich of the following does not present with an exudative pleural effusion?\nA.

NIV avoids the adverse effects of invasive ventilation and has become an important \nmechanism of ventilator support both inside and outside the ICU.\nForms of NIV include bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive air -\nway pressure (CPAP).\n• Bi-level positive airway  pressure  (BiPAP or BPAP) applies 2 different levels of PAP, \ni.e., it delivers positive pressure at alternating levels—higher for inspiration and lower \nfor expiration— optimizing lung efficiency and at the same time diminishing the \nwork of breathing. BPAP has been shown to be an effective management tool for \nCOPD and acute (pneumonia, status asthmaticus, etc.) and chronic respiratory failure.\n• Continuous positive airway pressure  (CPAP) applies air pressure on a continuous \nbasis, allowing the airways to continuously be open (splinted). It is typically used in \nthe treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, preterm infants with underdeveloped lungs, \nCHF with pulmonary edema, near drowning, and other severe causes of respiratory \ndistress. Portable CPAP machines used at home deliver a constant flow of pressure \nand are thus effective at preventing the airway from collapsing.\nInvasive Ventilation\nInvasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation, follows endotracheal intubation, and is used to \nimprove oxygen exchange during acute hypoxemic or hypercapnic respiratory failure with \nrespiratory acidosis. While hypoxemia and respiratory failure is one of the common reasons for \nendotracheal intubation, it is also introduced in order to protect the airways.\n• Positive end-expiratory  pressure  (PEEP) is the alveolar pressure above atmospheric \npressure that exists at the end of expiration.\n• Applied (extrinsic) PEEP  is one of the first ventilator settings chosen when mechani -\ncal ventilation is initiated, and it is set directly on the ventilator.\n• A small amount of applied PEEP (4−5 cm H2O) is used in most mechanically venti -\nlated patients to mitigate end-expiratory alveolar collapse. A higher level  \n(>5 cm H2O) is sometimes used to improve hypoxemia or reduce ventilator-  associated \nlung injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or another type of \nhypoxemic respiratory failure.\n• Complications of PEEP include decrease in systemic venous return, pulmonary \nbarotrauma, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalance.Note\nDon’t confuse BiPAP with \nCPAP , which applies a single \nlevel of positive airway \npressure throughout the whole \nrespiratory cycle and is used \nfor clinical conditions such as \nobstructive sleep apnea.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   343 16/05/19   11:09 AM",

There is evidence of \nwheezing throughout both lungs, but no crackles are noted. Supplemental oxygen \nby nasal cannula is administered. What should be the next appropriate treatment?\nAsthma is a disease characterized by inflammatory hyperreactivity of the respiratory tree \nto various stimuli, resulting in reversible  airway obstruction. A combination of mucosal \n inflammation, bronchial musculature constriction, and excessive secretion of viscous \n mucus-causing mucous plugs will produce bronchial obstruction. The bronchial hyperreactiv-\nity occurs in an episodic pattern with interspersed normal airway tone. \nAsthma can occur at any age but is usually seen in young persons, 50% of whom “outgrow” \ntheir asthma by adulthood.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   344 16/05/19   11:09 AM",
    "page_352": "Chapter 9   ●  Pulmonology\n345\nThere are 2 types of asthma. Many patients have features of both types.\n• Intrinsic or idiosyncratic asthma  (50% of asthmatics who are nonatopic \n [nonallergic]). A bronchial reaction occurs secondary to nonimmunologic stimuli, \nsuch as infection, irritating inhalant, cold air, exercise, and emotional upset. The \nasthma attacks are severe, and prognosis is less favorable.\n• Extrinsic (allergic, atopic) asthma  (20% of asthmatics) results from sensitization. \nSpecific immunoglobulins (IgE class [type 1]) are produced, and total serum IgE \nconcentration is elevated. There is a positive family history of allergic disease. Extrin -\nsic asthma is precipitated by allergens. Other symptoms include allergic rhinitis, \nurticaria, and eczema. Prognosis is good.\nRespiratory infections  are the most common stimuli to cause asthma exacerbation; studies \nhave documented that viruses (respiratory syncytial virus in young children, rhinoviruses in \nadults) are the major causes.\nPharmacologic stimuli  are very important in some cases; the most common etiologic agents \nassociated with asthma exacerbation are aspirin, coloring agents such as tartrazine, and \nβ-adrenergic antagonists.\n• The typical aspirin sensitivity (10% prevalence) nasal polyposis syndrome, affecting \nadults, starts with perennial vasomotor rhinitis; later, asthma occurs with minimal \ningestion of aspirin.\n• There is significant cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs. Patients can \nbe desensitized by daily administration of aspirin; cross-tolerance also develops to \nother NSAIDs.\n• The mechanism by which aspirin and similar drugs cause asthma appears to be \nchronic over-excretion of leukotrienes, which activate the mast cells. This is the reason \nwhy leukotriene inhibitors are considered to be so effective.\nPathophysiology.  There is a narrowing of large and small airways caused by hypertrophy and \nspasm of bronchial smooth muscle, edema and inflammation of the bronchial mucosa, and \nproduction of viscous mucus. The mediators released by the lung during an acute asthmatic \nattack are histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes (LTs) C, D, and E, and prostaglandins (PGs) E2, \nF2α, and D2, which cause an intense inflammatory process leading to bronchoconstriction and \nvascular congestion. The cells thought to play an important role in the inflammatory response \nare the mast cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils.\nSigns and Symptoms.  In a mild attack, slight tachypnea, tachycardia (increased respiratory \nrate), prolonged expirations, and mild, diffuse wheezing are seen. In a severe attack, use of \naccessory muscles of respiration, diminished breath sounds, loud wheezing, hyper-  resonance \n(increased vocal fremitus), and intercostal retraction are noted.\nPoor prognostic factors include fatigue, diaphoresis, pulsus paradoxus (>20 mm Hg), inaudible \nbreath sounds, decreased wheezing, cyanosis, and bradycardia.\nVariants of asthma include asthma presenting primarily with nocturnal cough  and exercise-\ninduced asthma  (both presentations of asthma are commonly tested).\nIn the acute phase, arterial blood gas (ABG)  abnormalities will be consistent with a decrease \nin arterial carbon dioxide tension (Pa CO2), increase in pH, and normal or low Pao2. In severe \nasthma or status asthmaticus there will be a decreased Pao2, increased Pa CO2, and decreased \npH (bicarbonate level usually will not be elevated in an acute setting, but it becomes elevated Clinical Pearl\nSamter’s triad  or aspirin-\nsensitive asthma:\n• Asthma\n• Nasal polyposis (causing \nrecurrent sinus disease)\n• Sensitivity to aspirin and \nNSAIDs\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   345 16/05/19   11:09 AM",

A normal Pa CO2 may indicate respiratory muscle \nfatigue in an acute asthmatic patient.\nChest x-ray findings  are nonspecific in an asthmatic attack. The chest x-ray may be helpful in \nruling out acute infection as the cause of an acute attack.\nDiagnosis.  PFTs show an obstructive pattern that typically reverses with bronchodilation \n(FEV1 must show 12% and 200 mL reversibility at 5 and 20 min with the use of a β2-adrenergic \nagonist). Sometimes the PFTs may be entirely normal because asthma is reversible and \nepisodic; in this case a provocative challenge may be performed with methacholine or cold air, \nwhich typically shows a decrease in FEV1/FVC or FEF25–75 of 20%.\nTreatment.  β-adrenergic agonist inhalers like albuterol (salbutamol) and terbutaline are the \nmainstay of treatment in acute and chronic asthma. Inhaled (metered-dose inhalers [MDIs]) \nβ-adrenergic agonists are the preferred route of administration because they allow maximal \nbronchodilation with minimal side effects. Their most common side effect is tremor. \nβ-adrenergic agonists alone terminate approximately 70% of asthmatic attacks.\nSalmeterol is a long-lasting (12 h) type of albuterol that is effective in nocturnal cough variant \nand exercise-induced asthma. Salmeterol has no benefit in acute episodes.\nβ-adrenergic agonists must be used with caution in patients who have coexisting cardiovascular \ndisorders, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary insufficiency.\nOther adrenergic stimulant drugs like the catecholamines  (isoproterenol, epinephrine, and \nisoetharine) are given orally or intravenously and are not routinely used.\nAminophylline  (ethylenediamine salt of theophylline) and theophylline  are only modest bron -\nchodilators. They are sometimes of benefit in chronic management, especially in  patients with \nnocturnal cough. Their mechanism of action is by improving contractility of the diaphragm as \nwell as other respiratory muscles. Generally, aminophylline and theophylline are not routinely \nused in asthma because they appear to add no benefit to optimal  inhaled beta-agonist therapy.\nAnticholinergic drugs  (ipratropium bromide and tiotropium) have particular benefit in patients \nwith heart disease, in whom the use of β-adrenergic agonists and theophylline may be danger -\nous. Their major disadvantages are that they take significant time  to achieve maximal broncho-\ndilation (~90 min) and they are only of medium potency.\nSupplemental oxygen , by nasal cannula or mask, should be given immediately when a patient \npresents with acute asthma exacerbation. Always maintain an oxygen saturation above 90%.\nThe use of “routine” antibiotic treatment  in asthma exacerbation has not been established. Two \nrecent prospective trials have not showed a benefit. Antibiotic treatment should be considered \nin patients with symptoms (purulent sputum) and chest x-ray findings (infiltrates) consistent \nwith bacterial pneumonia.\nTreatment of asthma in the outpatient  setting (chronic  management)  consists of looking for \nand removing environmental irritants and allergens. The goal is to remove or minimize \ncontact with precipitating factors of asthma (such as pets). \nInhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of chronic asthma therapy in adults. They work by \nreducing airway inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids have been shown in studies to reduce \nasthma exacerbations and hospitalizations. Side effects of inhaled corticosteroids include oral \ncandidiasis, glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, muscle weakness, and osteoporosis.

Systemic corticosteroids should not be used before inhaled cortico -\nsteroids.\nInhaled short-acting  beta 2 agonists such as albuterol are the mainstays of treatment of \nchronic asthma and are usually used in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids. Use of \nshort-acting beta-2 agonists for 3 days/week indicates poor control of symptoms, and treat-\nment should be intensified.\nInhaled long-acting  beta 2 agonists like salmeterol and formoterol have a sustained effect on \nbronchial smooth muscle relaxation. They are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe \npersistent asthma (after initial therapy with short-acting beta 2 agonist plus inhaled corticoste -\nroids), especially with a significant nocturnal component. A few things to note:\n• Not for use during acute exacerbation  of asthma\n• Not for use  alone ; always use in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids (studies show \nincreased mortality when long-acting beta 2 agonists are used as a single agent)\nThe leukotriene modifiers inhibit 5-lipoxygenase, the enzyme involved in leukotriene produc-\ntion (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4), or competitive antagonist the principal moiety (LTD4).

Zileuton is a typical leukotriene inhibitor \nthat is available. The receptor antagonists are zafirlukast and montelukast. \nMAST cell stabilizers (cromolyn and nedocromil) have been used in the treatment of chronic \nasthma. In terms of preventing asthma exacerbations and reducing inflammation in adults, \nthey are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. They may be used also in exercise-induced \nasthma and allergic asthma. Cromolyn and Nedocromil are used extensively in the chronic \ntreatment of pediatric asthma.\nClinical guidelines have classified asthma in 4 categories, based on frequency, severity of \nsymptoms, and requirements for medication. This classification provides general guidelines \nfor therapy.\n• Mild intermittent\n• Mild persistent\n• Moderate\n• Severe\nTreatment of asthma in the inpatient setting  (acute exacerbation) requires a different \napproach. Referring to the case presented earlier, the patient is likely having an acute exacer -\nbation of asthma.\n• The treatment of choice is bronchodilator (albuterol); systemic corticosteroids (usually \nstart IV), and oxygen. (Long-acting bronchodilators are contraindicated in the acute \nsetting.)\n• Bad prognostic indicators in this patient would be cyanosis, silent lung, increased \nCO2. An ABG of 7.32/45/60 (with CO2 of 45) would be considered ominous.Note\nNeither short-acting nor long-\nacting beta 2 agonists address \nthe inflammatory component \nof asthma.\nNote\nTheophylline  is generally not \npreferred for the treatment of \nasthma.  \n• For chronic asthma, use \nonly as a possible adjunct \nto inhaled corticosteroids \nfor difficult-to-control \nasthma.  \n• For an acute exacerbation \nof asthma, a long-acting \nbeta agonist plus inhaled \ncorticosteroids is more \neffective.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   347 16/05/19   11:09 AM",

In some peo -\nple, the effects of the allergic reaction combine with the effects of the fungus to damage the \nairways and lungs further.\n• The fungus does not actually invade the lung tissue and directly destroy it; rather, it \ncolonizes the mucus in the airways of patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis (both of \nwhom have increased amounts of mucus) and causes recurrent allergic inflammation \nin the lung.\n• The alveoli become packed primarily with eosinophils.\n• If the disease has caused extensive damage, bronchiectasis and scarring occur.\nThe first indications of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis are usually progressive \nsymptoms of asthma, such as wheezing and shortness of breath, and mild fever.

Clubbing of the Fingers Seen with Chronic Hypoxemia\nIn chronic bronchitis, increased pulmonary markings can be seen on chest x-ray; in emphy-\nsema, hyperinflation of bilateral lung fields with diaphragm flattening, small heart size, and \nincrease in retrosternal space can be seen.\nCor pulmonale in COPD is associated with chronic pulmonary hypertension.\nDiagnosis.  PFTs are the diagnostic test of choice. On PFT, a reduction in FEV1/FVC ratio and \nFEF25–75 occurs. RV and TLC are usually increased in COPD. Emphysema will have a \ndecreased DL CO, whereas chronic bronchitis will generally have a normal DL CO.\nAfter a bronchodilator is given, you would expect the FEV1/FVC to remain the same or \nimprove minimally.\nComplications.  Hypoxemia with nocturnal desaturation  is sometimes seen. Secondary erythro -\ncytosis  can result from chronically low Po2. Pulmonary hypertension is a complication that can \nlead to cor pulmonale  and subsequent right heart failure. Chronic ventilatory failure and CO2 \nretention are seen in chronic bronchitis early and at the end stages of emphysema.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   350 16/05/19   11:09 AM",
    "page_358": "Chapter 9   ●  Pulmonology\n351\nManagement of Stable Phase COPD.  The goal in treatment is to treat airway inflammation \nand bronchospasm, reduce airway resistance and work of breathing, and improve gas exchange \nand ventilation-perfusion ( V •/Q) mismatching.\nAnticholinergic agents  (ipratropium bromide and tiotropium) are the first-line drugs in \nCOPD. These agents are given via MDI and control airway caliber and tone. Anticholinergic \nagents can be used synergistically with β2-adrenergic agonists in patients with COPD.\nβ2-adrenergic agonists  (albuterol) are used after anticholinergic agents. The inhaled route is \nthe preferred administration.\nBeta agonists are not first-line agents in the management of COPD because many of the \npatients have underlying heart disease and the tachycardia commonly associated with these \nagents may precipitate heart failure. \nChronic inhaled corticosteroids  are reserved for severe cases of COPD. \nTheophylline, a xanthine derivative, may be added to the regimen if beta-2 agonists and \nanticholinergics are not effective in managing the symptoms of chronic obstructive lung \ndisease. Remember that theophylline has significant toxicity. Symptoms include nausea and \nvomiting, palpitations, and tremulousness. Death can occur from theophylline toxicity from \ncardiac arrhythmias.\nThe list of drug interactions with theophylline is significant. Theophylline levels increase with \nfluoroquinolones, clarithromycin, H2-blockers (cimetidine, ranitidine), certain beta blockers \nand calcium channel blockers. Theophylline levels decrease (due to increased clearance) with \nrifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and smoking.\nDespite the above treatments, the only interventions which have been shown to decrease \nmortality in patients with COPD are home oxygen  and smoking cessation.\nHome oxygen therapy is given to patients with hypoxemia (Pao2 <55 mm Hg or saturation \n<88%), and the goal is to try to keep the O2 saturation >90% as much as possible, especially at \nnight when patients generally desaturate. Patients with cor pulmonale will benefit from home \noxygen when Pao2 <59 mm Hg. A special category is the patient who desaturates with exercise; \nin that case, intermittent oxygen will be beneficial.\nAll patients with COPD must have the pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax®) every 5 years and \nthe influenza vaccine yearly. They should also receive the H. influenzae  vaccine if they were not \npreviously immunized.\nSeveral trials have failed to find a beneficial effect for the regular chronic use of inhaled \ncorticosteroids in patients with COPD.\nManagement and Treatment of COPD Exacerbation (Acute Setting Treatment).  Acute \nexacerbation of COPD is considered acute worsening of the patient’s respiratory symptoms \n(increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, production of purulent sputum) that necessi-\ntates a change in medications.\nThe most common causes of COPD exacerbation are viral lung infections. Other precipitating \ncauses that should be sought out are bacterial infections, heart failure, myocardial ischemia, \npulmonary embolism, lung cancer, esophageal reflux disease, and medications (e.g., beta-blockers).\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   351 16/05/19   11:09 AM",
    "page_359": "USMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\n352\nInitial Management\n1. Measure O2 saturation  via pulse oximetry (on the spot) to determine oxygen \nsaturation.\n2. ABG determination  is very useful to identify the level of hypercapnia and thus \nthe severity of exacerbation.\n3. Chest x-ray  is expected in all patients with COPD exacerbation to identify pulmo -\nnary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. It may also show evidence of pulmo -\nnary edema, indicating possible heart failure as the cause of the exacerbation.\n4. Spirometry (and other PFT evaluation) is not helpful in COPD exacerbation \nbecause measurements (FEV1, etc.) have not been shown to correlate well with \nthe severity of the exacerbation.\n5. In the acute setting, check levels in patients on chronic treatment with theophyl -\nline. Drugs like erythromycin, cimetidine, and ciprofloxacin may decrease \ntheophylline clearance and cause theophylline toxicity .\n6. Other tests as part of the initial evaluation of COPD exacerbation might include CBC  \n(looking for elevated WBCs and polycythemia); ECG (looking for new arrhythmias, \ne.g., atrial fibrillation that may precipitate heart failure and exacerbate COPD).\n7. Any significant changes of hypercapnia or hypoxemia from baseline should \nprompt consideration for admission to the hospital.  Also, patients on home O2 \nwho have exacerbation, and those with severe symptoms, should be hospitalized.\n8. Consider intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients with decreased levels \nof consciousness, cyanosis, or hemodynamic instability and in those with \npersistent hypoxemia despite adequate oxygen supplementation.\nSpecific Therapy\n1. Oxygen  supplementation  should be titrated to ~90% saturation on the pulse \noximeter. The main concern is to deliver adequate oxygenation. In COPD \nexacerbation, CO2 retention is a secondary issue. \n2. Inhaled bronchodilators  are the most effective  medications to improve \nairway diameter (the drugs of choice). In acute COPD exacerbations, use both \nbeta-  agonists (albuterol) and anticholinergics (ipratropium) simultaneously . \nTrials have shown that administration of these drugs by a nebulizer or metered \ndose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer is equally efficacious. Patients with severe \nexacerbations are unable to hold their breath for more than a few seconds and \nare thus initially treated with nebulizers and then switched to the MDIs.\n3. Systemic corticosteroids  have now been shown in multiple trials to shorten the \nrecovery time of lung function and decrease the length of stay in patients with \nCOPD exacerbation. Corticosteroids may be given intravenously or orally \nbecause the efficacy is similar  in both modes of administration. The equivalent \nof 60 mg prednisone appears to be the sufficient starting dose and is usually \ncontinued for 2 weeks. It makes sense clinically to start patients who have a \nsevere exacerbation with IV methylprednisolone (it is difficult for these patients \n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   352 16/05/19   11:09 AM",
    "page_360": "Chapter 9   ●  Pulmonology\n353\nto take oral meds), then change to oral prednisone as they improve. Inhaled \ncorticosteroids have not been shown to improve outcomes in patients with COPD \nexacerbation and cannot be substituted for systemic corticosteroids.\n4. Antibiotics  seem to be beneficial in COPD exacerbations despite “normal” chest \nradiograms. Patients with productive, purulent cough benefit the most because \nthey are more likely to have an underlying bacterial infection. Antibiotics \ncommonly used are second-generation macrolides (clarithromycin, azithromy -\ncin), extended-spectrum fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), cephalo -\nsporins (second- and third-generation), and amoxicillin clavulanate.\n5. There is no real benefit to using IV aminophylline. However, if the patient is using \ntheophylline on a chronic basis (in outpatient setting), it should be  continued \nduring the exacerbation because abrupt discontinuation may worsen symptoms.\n6. Always avoid opiates and sedatives because they may suppress the respiratory \nsystem.\n7. Although specific chest physiotherapy (postural drainage, etc.) has not been \nshown to benefit patients with exacerbation, they should be encouraged to \nincrease activities as tolerated to prevent deconditioning.\n8. Counseling the patient on smoking cessation in the hospital setting is the single \nmost important intervention. \n9. Teaching the patient optimal use of MDIs has been shown to reduce readmission \nrates.\nPrognosis.  FEV1 is the best predictor of survival (the higher the FEV1, the better the survival \nand the less symptomatic the patients). The rate of FEV1 decline may also predict survival \nbecause patients with a faster decline will have increased morbidity. Patients that have  \nan FEV1 ≤25% will usually complain of dyspnea at rest.\nTobacco cessation is the only means of slowing progression of COPD and the decrease in FEV1.\nIt is very important that patients with COPD have vaccinations against Pneumococcus  with a \nbooster at 5 years and yearly for influenza. Some experts consider the H. influenzae  vaccine \nmandatory.\nGoing back to our patient, you would likely find decreased DLCO on her PFTs. Treatment of this \npatient in the acute exacerbation would be systemic steroids, antibiotics, and bronchodilators, \nwith O2 as needed. Treatment once she goes home would be ipratropium inhaler and home O2.\nTo assess the severity of this patient’s disease, measure FEV1. \nBronchiectasis\nA 17-year-old girl is admitted to the hospital with a right lower lobe pneumonia. \nShe gives you a history of recurrent pneumonias, some of which have kept her in \nthe hospital for weeks, and of chronic productive cough that occurs every day.

ILD is characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the interstitium and \nlung parenchyma. The worst prognosis is with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and usual \ninterstitial pneumonitis.\nThe interstitium of the lung (supporting structure) is the area in and around the small blood \nvessels and alveoli where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place. Inflamma-\ntion and scarring of the interstitium (and eventually extension into the alveoli) will disrupt \nnormal gas exchange. Although the progression of ILD may be variable from one disease to \nanother, there are common clinical, radiographic, and spirometric findings.\nAll patients with ILD develop exertional dyspnea (the most common complaint that brings them \nto the physician) and nonproductive cough. Examination shows the typical coarse crackles, \nevidence of pulmonary hypertension (increased pulmonic sound, right heart failure), and \nclubbing (not always). Chest x-ray is consistent with reticular or reticulonodular pattern (“ground-\nglass” appearance).

Usually, pneumo-\nconiosis appears 20–30 years after constant exposure to offending agents (metal mining of \ngold, silver, lead, copper), but it can develop in <10 years when dust exposure is  extremely \nhigh.\nHistory  is of primary importance in assessing possible occupational lung diseases.\nPathology.  Alveolar macrophages engulf offending agents, causing inflammation and  fibrosis \nof the lung parenchyma in pneumoconiosis. Respiratory insufficiency is the ultimate conse-\nquence of the pneumoconioses.\nSigns and symptoms include dyspnea, shortness of breath, cough, sputum production, cor \npulmonale, and clubbing.

Patients with asbestos exposure should strongly be advised to stop \nsmoking since their risk of lung cancer is 75 times higher than that of the normal population.\nSilicosis\nSilicosis is an occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of silica dust. It is seen in \n individuals who work in mining, quarrying, tunneling, glass and pottery making, and \n sandblasting.\nSilicosis causes similar symptoms to asbestosis (or any other pneumoconiosis) except the acute \nform of silicosis, which is caused by massive exposure that causes lung failure in months.\nPathology.  Silica causes inflammatory reactions with pathologic lesions being the hyaline nodule.\nChest X-Ray.  In silicosis there are nodules (1–10 mm) seen throughout the lungs that are most \nprominent in the upper lobes. A characteristic finding is eggshell calcifications (rare). In \nprogressive massive fibrosis, densities are 10 mm or more and coalesce in large masses.\nDiagnosis is made with lung biopsy. There is no effective therapy for silicosis. Death occurs \nusually because of progressive respiratory insufficiency.\nCoal miner’s lung/coal worker’s pneumoconiosis\nThe risk of development and progression of coal miner’s lung (CWP) is related to the amount \nof coal dust exposure, higher rank (hardness) of coals, and increased silica content of inhaled \ndust. Simple CWP is seen in 12% of all miners.\nPatients clinically present as they would with any other occupational lung disease. On chest \nx-ray, small round densities are seen in the parenchyma, usually involving the upper half of the \nlungs.

Pulmonary Embolism CT\n• Pulmonary embolism:\n –CT pulmonary angiogram (CT-PA) is the most frequently performed initial test for \nthe diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. It allows direct visualization of the pulmo -\nnary embolus, and it also allows for the diagnosis of alternative diseases involving \nthe lung parenchyma (pneumonia, pneumothorax, etc.). The older generation of \nCT-PAs may miss pulmonary emboli that involve the smaller (peripheral) pulmo -\nnary arteries.\n –Ventilation-perfusion ( V•/Q•) scan is a pair of nuclear scan tests that use inhaled and \ninjected material to measure breathing (ventilation) and circulation (perfusion) in \nall areas of the lung. A pulmonary embolus will typically cause perfusion defects \nwith normal ventilation. The V•/Q• scan, depending on the number of defects, is \nclassified as normal, low probability, intermediate probability, or high probability. \nPatients that have any preexisting lung disease (COPD) will have at least intermedi -\nate scans, which make this test less helpful. A normal V•/Q• scan rules out pulmo -\nnary embolus.\n –Pulmonary angiogram  is the gold standard procedure for the diagnosis of pulmo -\nnary embolus. Its risk of complication (e.g., pulmonary artery rupture) is <1%.

Elevated D-dimer \nindicates the presence of an abnormally high level of fibrin degradation products, \npossibly because of thrombus formation and breakdown. An elevated D-dimer may \nbe due to a thromboembolism, but it may also be due to a recent surgery, infection, \ntrauma, pregnancy, and DIC. Normal D-dimer tests mean that there is no throm -\nbus formation or breakdown. For the above reasons, a D-dimer can only be used to \nrule out PE or DVT if the levels are  normal. Trials have shown that the D-dimer is \nmost useful when the test is done on patients considered to be low-risk and is \nrecommended as an adjunct test (i.e., a negative D-dimer and a normal CT-PA scan \nrule out thromboembolism 98% of the time).\n –There are many types of D-dimer tests with different sensitivities. The ELISA assay \nis the best test overall, whereas the latex agglutination test is less sensitive.\nGeneral diagnostic concepts in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism:\n• It makes sense to start with a CT-PA after a chest x-ray is completed.\n• Normal CT scan and normal D-dimer test in low-risk patients exclude pulmonary \nembolism.\n• Normal CT scan and normal Doppler U/S in low-risk patients exclude pulmonary \nembolism.\n• Even if all tests are negative for pulmonary embolism but the patient is high risk, go \nfor the angiogram.\n• If a V•/Q•  scan is completely normal (not near normal or low probability), the chance of \npulmonary embolism is almost 0%.\n• Know how to use Doppler U/S in the evaluation of pulmonary embolism. For exam -\nple, if a V•/Q•  scan is reported as low probability, still be concerned about pulmonary \nembolism. An angiogram is not preferred unless absolutely necessary because it is an \ninvasive procedure. Therefore, do an U/S of both lower extremities to look for a DVT \n(remember that most pulmonary emboli are complications of DVTs arising in the \nproximal veins).\n• All patients (especially high risk) should be on anticoagulation while completing \ndiagnostic evaluations, so start heparin before sending that patient off to the radiology \ndepartment for the CT or the V•/Q•  scan.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   364 16/05/19   11:10 AM",

Dosing is based on patient’s weight, and the effect is very predictable. The long \nhalf-life makes it ideal for a 1× or 2×/day dosing interval. Trials have shown that LMWH is as \ngood as unfractionated heparin in the treatment of DVT and pulmonary emboli; also, LMWH is \nless likely to cause hemorrhage or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).\nHIT is a common complication of heparin treatment and occurs 5–7 days after starting \ntreatment in about 5% of patients. Paradoxically, it is associated more with thrombotic events \nthan bleeding diathesis. Always stop heparin when platelets decrease by a significant amount. \nAlso, consider HIT in a patient with recurrent pulmonary embolism or DVT despite heparin \ntreatment. HIT is treated with the new anticoagulants (argatroban, lepirudin).\nWarfarin works by inhibiting the vitamin K–dependent factors (II, VII, IX, and X). Because \nfactor VII has the shortest half-life of all the affected factors, prothrombin time (PT) is \nmonitored to assess the warfarin anticoagulant effect. International normalized ratio (INR) is a \nway to report PT and is used to control for variability in PT between different laboratories. The \nwarfarin dose should be titrated to an INR of 2–3 for effective anticoagulation.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   365 16/05/19   11:10 AM",

Protein C is also a vitamin-dependent factor \nwith a shorter half-life than factor VII. A “transient hypercoagulable state” occurs when \nwarfarin is started in patients with subclinical protein C deficiency. This leads to diffuse \nthrombosis of the skin and other organs. By starting patients on heparin and warfarin at the \nsame time, you minimize the risk for this complication.\nAnticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with recent neurosurgery or eye surgery. \nConsider using an inferior vena cava filter (Greenfield filter) to prevent further embolism in \nthese patients.\nWarfarin is contraindicated in pregnant patients. LMWH for 6 months is the best alternative. \nThe patient should have injections once or twice a day.\nThrombolytics (tPA, streptokinase) are not used routinely in pulmonary embolism and should \nbe reserved for patients that become hemodynamically unstable (indicated by hypotension, \nright heart failure, etc.). In clinical practice, thrombolytics are sometimes also  considered in \npatients with massive DVT to prevent the postphlebitic syndrome.\nAlthough the available vitamin K antagonists are highly effective for the prevention and \ntreatment of most thrombotic disease, significant patient variability in dose response, the \nnarrow therapeutic index, and the numerous drug and dietary interactions associated with \nthese agents have led clinicians to search for alternative agents. These new anti-thrombotic \ndrugs have relatively discrete targets within the coagulation pathway. Two new classes of orally \nadministered anticoagulants, inhibitors of factor X and thrombin inhibitors, have been \napproved for the management and prevention of venous thromboembolic disease. Rivaroxa-\nban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor that has been \napproved for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\nThe postthrombotic syndrome (postphlebitic syndrome) is the most common complication of \nDVT, occurring in up to two-thirds of patients. It may result from some obstructions that \nremain in the vein or backflow of blood due to destruction of the valves or both. Signs and \nsymptoms include pain, edema, hyperpigmentation, and skin ulceration. The use of compres-\nsion stockings has been shown to prevent the postthrombotic syndrome.\nOther Concepts in Treatment\n• Noncomplicated proximal DVTs are usually treated for a total of 6 months.\n• In patients with thrombophilias (hypercoagulable states), lifelong anticoagulation is \nconsidered with warfarin (usually reserved for at least 2 episodes of thrombosis).\n• Do not check for protein C or protein S deficiency during acute thrombosis. Both \nwarfarin (which the patient should be on) and acute clot formation lower  protein C \nand S.\n• In patients that develop recurrent thrombosis while on anticoagulants, consider HIT \nor cancer-related thrombosis (very resistant). Consider placing an inferior vena cava \n(IVC) filter or using some of the newer anticoagulant classes (e.g., hirudin derivatives). \nIVC filters are associated with clot formation around the filter site and may cause \npulmonary thromboembolism.\n• Limited distal DVTs  (below-the-knee DVT) are not themselves a cause of pulmonary \nembolism, unless they extend to the proximal veins. Management of distal DVT \nincludes 2 options: monitor for possible extension to the proximal veins by using serial \nU/S or treat with anticoagulation for 3 months.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   366 16/05/19   11:10 AM",

When  noninvasive \nmeasures are not effective, surgical procedures (uvuloplasty) may be considered.\n• Central  sleep apnea (<5%) is caused by inadequate ventilatory drive. Treatment \nincludes conservative measures (weight loss; avoidance of alcohol, sedatives, and sleep \ndeprivation), acetazolamide, progesterone, and supplemental oxygen.\nThe diagnosis of sleep apnea is based on evaluation of clinical symptoms (daytime sleepiness, \nfatigue, sleep diary findings, and the results of objective testing with polysomnography.\nLUNG CANCER\nBronchogenic Carcinoma\nA 65-year-old man is admitted because of headache and blurry vision the past \nfew days.

The far majority of cases are directly related to cigarette smoking; the occasional non-\nsmoker who has lung cancer develops adenocarcinoma.\nAll lung cancers are associated with smoking.\n• Active smokers have 10× greater risk compared with nonsmokers\n• Risk is directly related to number of pack-years (40-pack-year history increases risk \n60–70×)\n• Those with asbestos exposure have 75x greater risk of bronchogenic carcinoma \ncompared with nonexposed individuals\nThere is no available screening test for lung cancer at this time.\nPathology.  The most common lung cancers are adenocarcinoma (~40% in some studies) and \nsquamous cell carcinoma.\n• Adenocarcinoma.  Adenocarcinoma is a peripherally located lesion. This lesion \nmetastasizes widely to essentially the same sites as small-cell carcinoma. \n Bronchioalveolar carcinoma is a subtype of adenocarcinoma; it is a low-grade carci -\nnoma that can occur in single or multiple nodules. Asbestos exposure can be an \nunderlying causative agent, usually after a latent period of 30 years. Adenocarcinoma \nis usually associated with pleural effusions that have high hyaluronidase levels. \nDiagnosis often requires thoracotomy with pleural biopsy.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   368 16/05/19   11:10 AM",

Squamous cell carcinoma usually metastasizes by \ndirect extension into the hilar node and mediastinum. These lesions are associated \nwith hypercalcemia from the secretion of a parathyroid hormone–like substance.\n• Small-Cell Carcinoma.  Small-cell carcinomas are centrally located lesions. These \ntumors are rapidly growing with early distant metastasis to extrathoracic sites such as \nliver, adrenal glands, brain, and bone. Prognosis does not improve with early diagno -\nsis. Small-cell carcinoma is associated with Eaton-Lambert syndrome, syndrome of \ninappropriate antidiuretic hormone, and other paraneoplastic syndromes. Small-cell \ncarcinoma is also the most common cause of venocaval obstruction syndrome.\n• Large-Cell Carcinoma.  Large-cell carcinoma is a peripherally located lesion. This \ncarcinoma can metastasize to distant locations late in the course of disease. Large-cell \ncarcinoma in early stages is associated with cavitation.\nSymptoms.  The most common symptom at the time of diagnosis is cough (74%). Weight loss \nis seen in 68% of patients. Dyspnea is seen in 58% of patients. Other associated symptoms of \nbronchogenic carcinoma include hemoptysis, chest wall pain, and repeated pneumonic \nprocesses (caused by postobstructive pneumonia).\nHoarseness when seen indicates a nonresectable bronchogenic carcinoma.\nDiagnosis.  The diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma can be made by sputum cytology, with \nthe highest yield in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (>80%) because it is intraluminal \nand centrally located. Bronchoscopy is best for centrally located lesions (yield of 90%) and is \nhelpful in staging. For the 10% of centrally located lesions not detected by bronchoscopy, a \nneedle aspiration biopsy should be performed if carcinoma is highly suspect. In other words, \nif there is a high degree of suspicion for carcinoma and the bronchoscopy results are nonspe -\ncific, a biopsy must be requested. Needle aspiration biopsy is also good for peripheral nodules \nwith pleural fluid aspirate (positive in 40–50% of cases). Mediastinoscopy is useful in diagnos -\ning and staging mediastinal tumors.\n• Workup of a chest x-ray with an effusion and a lung mass.  Ninety percent of tumors \nwith malignant effusions are unresectable. These tumors are usually adenocarcino -\nmas. Atelectasis on chest x-ray suggests central airway obstruction. Next step in such a \npatient is to do thoracocentesis and cytologic evaluation of the pleural fluid.\nTreatment.  Symptoms that suggest an unresectable lesion include weight loss >10%, bone pain \nor other extrathoracic metastases, CNS symptoms (treated by radiation or chemotherapy), \nsuperior vena cava syndrome, hoarseness, mediastinal adenopathy on the contralateral side, \nsplit-lung test tidal volume <800 ml, tumor classification of M1 within 3 months, and tumor \ninvolving the trachea, esophagus, pericardium, or chest wall.\nResectable lesions of small-cell carcinoma are treated with chemotherapy; VP16 (etoposide and \nplatinum) is the treatment of choice. Surgery is not indicated for these lesions. Non-small-cell \nlesions that are resectable are treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy or CAP \n (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and platinum). Effusions can be sclerosed with tetracycline. \nComplications are treated with radiation therapy, which in most cases is palliative.\nPrognosis is best after surgical resection of squamous-cell carcinoma (30–35%). Large-cell \ncarcinoma and adenocarcinoma have a prognosis of 25%. Prognosis is poorest for small-cell \ncarcinoma.\n09_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch09.indd   369 16/05/19   11:10 AM",

His respiratory rate is \n22/min and pulse 112/min. He has a mild fever, and decreased breath sounds \nare noted in the left lower lobe. Complete blood count shows leukocytosis \n27,000/mm3.\nAtelectasis is a collapse of part or the entire lung. It is most commonly seen in the immediate \npostoperative period, often secondary to poor inspiration or lack of coughing. A mucous plug, \ntumor, or foreign body can also lead to atelectasis.\nAcute symptoms include tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, and hypoxemia. In the chronic phase \npatients may be asymptomatic with only x-ray abnormalities. On x-ray, upper lobe atelectasis can \nappear as tracheal deviation to the affected side. This phenomenon occurs secondary to volume \nloss from atelectasis. Lower lobe atelectasis may cause an elevation of the corresponding part of \nthe diaphragm. In massive atelectasis, a mediastinal shift to the involved side can be seen. The \natelectatic lobe will appear to be densely consolidated and smaller than the normal lobe on x-ray.\nTreatment.

Without the \nEKG, defibrillator, and cardiac medication, there is very little a rescuer can do for a \npatient with a serious dysrhythmia beyond chest compressions and opening the airway.\n• If a patient has a serious dysrhythmia such as asystole or ventricular fibrillation, there \nis virtually no survival if the heart has not been restarted within 10 minutes. Chest \ncompressions just perfuse vital organs; they will not convert the arrhythmia back to \nnormal sinus.

An EKG is done and reveals ventricular \nfibrillation. He has no spontaneous respirations.\nVentricular fibrillation is significant electrical activity on EKG with no signs of an organized \npattern. The most common causes are ischemia, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and \nsevere underlying cardiac disease. Remember the “Hs and Ts. ”\nPresentation is a dead person with ventricular fibrillation on EKG. Diagnosis is entirely based \non the EKG.\nTreatment.  The differences between defibrillation and cardioversion are very important.\n• Defibrillation  is a nonsynchronized delivery of shock at any phase of cardiac cycle. It \nis used in VF and pulseless VT. During defibrillation you depolarize all of the \nmyocytes simultaneously, hoping that the SA node will start up normal sinus rhythm.\n• Cardioversion  is a synchronized shock with the QRS complex. When performing \ncardioversion, the defibrillator will not shock until the QRS complex appears. You will \nbe able to see spikes over the QRS complexes on the monitor. If you shock on the T \nwave, when ventricular repolarization is taking place, you may induce VF.\nMake sure that the SYN button is pushed when performing cardioversion. Use UNsynchro-\nnized shock (defibrillation) for VF or pulseless VT only.\nFigure 10-3.  Ventricular Fibrillation Figure 10-3. Ventricular Fibrillation\nPost-Resuscitation Care.  Most patients who survive resuscitation have anoxic brain injury. \nTherapeutic hypothermia reduces the risk of this type of severe neurologic injury. Initiate it if a \npatient is not following commands or showing purposeful movements.  The goal of the \nprotocol is to reach core temperature 32–34 C (90–93 F) within 6 hours and maintain for \n12–24 hours. This can be done with ice packs, cooling blankets, or cold IV fluids. \nAbsolute contraindications for induced hypothermia are active bleeding and do-not-  resuscitate \norder. Note\nThe exact mechanism of \ncardiovascular collapse in an \nindividual is often impossible \nto establish since patients \nrarely have cardiac electrical \nactivity monitored.

He falls to his side into the lap of the woman sitting next to him. He is awake \nbut disoriented and confused. He is complaining of dyspnea and lightheadedness. \nHis exam reveals jugulovenous distention and blood pressure 114/80 mm Hg. EKG \nshows ventricular tachycardia at rate 180 beats/min.\nVentricular tachycardia (VT) is a wide complex tachycardia with an organized, uniform \npattern on the EKG. No P-waves are visible. It is most commonly caused by ischemia, myocar -\ndial infarction, and anatomic cardiac disease. Other possible etiologies include quinidine, \ntricyclics, phenothiazines, and long QT syndromes. \nThe dysrhythmia originates from an ectopic focus in the myocardium or from the AV node. \nWhen the impulse originates from around the AV node, this is from reentry. The electrical \nimpulses must travel throughout the myocardium, from myocyte to myocyte, without the \nbenefit of the more rapidly conducting normal pathways such as the bundle branches or \nHis-Purkinje fibers.\nThe slowness of the conduction produces the slower and therefore wider complexes on EKG. \nThe rate most often varies 160–240/min. Torsade de pointes  is a form of VT in which the \nmorphology varies with an undulating amplitude, making it seem that it “twists around a point. ” \nTorsade may be associated with hypomagnesemia and preceded by  long QT interval . \nFigure 10-5.  TorsadeFigure 10-5. Torsade (Polymorphic VT)\nSymptoms are often related to duration of the dysrhythmia. Short bursts of a few seconds may \nproduce no symptoms at all. VT lasting >30 seconds is referred to as sustained VT. Symptoms \ninclude lightheadedness, hypotension, CHF, syncope, and death.\nDiagnosis . The EKG shows the VT. For those patients presenting with syncope suspected to be \nof cardiac origin and in whom an arrhythmia is not visible on the initial EKG, an electrophysi-\nologic study can be done to try to elicit the VT.Note\nMedications that prolong QT \ninterval\nTCAs\nAntipsychotics\nMacrolides\nMethadone\nFluoroquinolones\nAmiodarone\nQuinidine\nClass III: sotalol, ibutilide, \ndofetilide\nProcainamide\nCauses of prolonged QT and \nTorsade\nHypothyroidism\nHypokalemia\nHypocalcemia\nCongenital or prolonged QT \nsyndrome\nNote\nAmiodarone is superior to \nlidocaine for VF/VT.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   377 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

For those with sustained VT and with a pulse who are hemodynamically unstable, \nimmediate synchronized cardioversion is required. Signs of hemodynamic instability requiring \ncardioversion include hypotension, chest pain, altered mental status, and CHF. A lower dose of \nelectricity, starting at 100 J, can be used at first for monomorphic VT. The cardioversion should \nbe synchronized. Conscious patients should be sedated with midazolam, fentanyl, or morphine \nbefore cardioversion. \nVT for those without a pulse should be managed in the same way as ventricular fibrillation \n(unsynchronized shock). Stable VT (wide, monomorphic, regular) without serious hemody-\nnamic compromise can be treated medically with antiarrhythmics.\nMagnesium may be useful in general but it is most useful for Torsade de pointes; if it fails \nto treat Torsade, then try isoproterenol or lidocaine. Overdrive pacing can be used if \n pharmacologic treatment fails. Patients undergoing cardioversion should be sedated first with \nmedications like  midazolam, fentanyl, or morphine. Long-term therapy is most effective with \nbeta-blockers. VT that produces sudden death or that is sustained through initial drug therapy \nmay require the placement of an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) or catheter ablation \ntechnique. All patients with ejection fraction <35% should have ICD due to increased risk of \nVT and VF.\nPulseless Electrical Activity\nPulseless electrical activity (PEA) is hypotension to the point of losing one’s pulse; there is still \nsome type of electrical activity on the EKG that may even be normal or a simple tachycardia. \nMore than the other dysrhythmias, knowing the etiology PEA is the key to the therapy because \nthe specific therapies are so divergent. \nEssentially, the heart may still be beating, but there is no blood in the heart, and therefore there is \nno cardiac output. Causes of PEA are severe hypovolemia, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumo -\nthorax, massive pulmonary embolism, and a massive myocardial infarction. Other causes in \nwhich there may not be actual muscular contraction are hypoxia, hypothermia, potassium \ndisorders, acidosis, and drug overdoses with tricyclics, digoxin, beta-blockers, or calcium-chan -\nnel blockers.\nThe patient appears to be dead with no pulse. Other symptoms are based on the specific nature \nof what led to the PEA, such as those described. Diagnosis is made with a pulseless patient who \nhas significantly organized, and occasionally normal, activity on EKG.\nTreatment.  The most important action is to maintain CPR while determining the specific \norigin of the PEA. General therapy includes CPR, IV access, intubation, and epinephrine. Do \nnot shock PEA arrest. The most important therapy is repair of the cause. Bicarbonate is useful Note\nFor patients with sustained \nmonomorphic VT and are \nhemodynamically stable, after \nrecording a 12-lead ECG, \nconsider starting an IV anti-\narrhythmic agent \n(amiodarone, lidocaine) and \nreserving electrical \ncardioversion for refractory \npatients who become \nunstable.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   378 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

He has been studying vigorously for the USMLE Step 2 exam \nand has been up for the last 24 hours. He has had 5 cups of coffee, 4 beers, \n3 stimulant tablets, 2 cheeseburgers, and 1 sildenafil (Viagra). Electrocardiogram \nreveals an atrial dysrhythmia.\nAtrial fibrillation (A-fib) , atrial flutte r, and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are all \ncharacterized by an ectopic focus in the atrium or re-entry at the AV node. \n• All have normal conduction in the ventricular myocardium once the impulse \nsuccessfully passes the AV node and travels down the normal ventricular \n conduction system. \n• All have a normal or narrow QRS complex and the absence of a normal P-wave.\n• A-fib is caused by chronic hypertension (most common), but valvular heart disease \n(most often mitral valve pathology), left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, \natrial fibrosis, atrial dilation, CAD, and CHF are other causes. Another cause is \ntoxicity causing overstimulation of the heart, i.e., hyperthyroidism, pheochromocy -\ntoma, caffeine, theophylline, alcohol, and cocaine. Drug toxicity (such as digoxin), \npericarditis, pulmonary embolism, surgery, chest wall trauma, or ischemia can also \ncause atrial dysrhythmias.\n• SVT is caused by a re-entrant mechanism around or within the AV node.\nClinical Presentation.  Symptoms vary on the basis of the duration of the disorder, the ven -\ntricular rate, and the underlying health of the heart. \n• With a normal heart, only 10–20% of cardiac output is directly derived from the \ncontribution of atrial systole.\n• With a dilated or postinfarction heart, or with significant valvular disease, this \ncontribution may rise to 30–40%, in which case more severe symptoms arise: from Note\nA-fib, atrial flutter, and SVT are \ndiscussed as a group because \ntheir initial management has \nconsiderable overlap.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   379 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

Wide complex tachy-\ncardia can be atrial or ventricular. For example, it is very difficult to distinguish A-fib in the \npresence of LBBB and VT. The key is that in A-fib with LBBB, the rate is irregular on EKG, \nwhereas in VT it is regular. If in doubt, treat as VT.\nDiagnosis.  Initially, the diagnosis is based entirely on the EKG.

Initial therapy is based on whether there are signs/symptoms of severe hemody-\nnamic compromise, such as hypotension, confusion, CHF, or chest pain. If there are signs, \nperform immediate synchronized cardioversion. \nIf the patient is hemodynamically stable, then the first step is to control the ventricular rate. \nFor SVT, a vagal maneuver such as carotid sinus massage, Valsalva, or ice water immersion is \nmost effective. \n• The modified Valsalva maneuver is more effective than the standard technique:  do Val -\nsalva followed by supine repositioning and immediate passive leg raise .\n• Do not do carotid sinus massage bilaterally. \n• Do not do carotid massage on patients with carotid bruits. \nIf vagal maneuvers do not work, treat SVT with several rapid IV infusions of adenosine. (Do \nnot use adenosine in patients with asthma or COPD, as it can cause bronchospasms.) \nIf adenosine is not effective, use a calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem or verapamil), beta-\nblocker, or digoxin to slow the heart rate. \n• Try to avoid verapamil in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and low \nejection fraction.\n• Be cautious using beta-blockers in patients with a history of reactive airway disease.\nAfter the rate has been lowered <110/min, conversion of the rhythm to normal sinus does not \nneed to be routinely done. Chronic rate control with anticoagulation with warfarin to INR 2–3 is \nsuperior to converting the patient into sinus rhythm. Returning the patient to a normal sinus \nrhythm is preferable because chronic A-fib can result in embolic stroke (5–7% of patients per \nyear). \nAmiodarone, ibutilide, propafenone, and dofetilide can all convert a minority of patients to \nsinus rhythm. (At the level of the Step 2 exam, you will not need to know much about the \nspecific indications for each, though you will need to know that elective cardioversions should \nbe preceded and followed by several weeks of anticoagulation with warfarin.)\nAvoid adenosine in asthma and COPD, as it can cause bronchospasms.\nRate Control vs. Rhythm Control.  When patients present in A-fib with rapid ventricular \nresponse, hemodynamic stability must first be determined. \n• If hemodynamically stable: rate-control with AV nodal blocking agents \n• If unstable, do immediate synchronized cardioversionNote\nPalpitations  and \nlightheadedness  are not signs \nof hemodynamic \ncompromise . \nNote\nFor patients with  A-fib and \nflutter , give rate control \ntreatment plus \nanticoagulation  (aspirin, \nwarfarin, etc).

He feels well and has no symptoms. He takes no medications. \nOn examination you find a blood pressure 118/76 mm Hg and pulse 40/min.\nBradycardia is a slow heart with rate <60 beats/min. \n• Sinus bradycardia  can be a normal phenomenon, particularly in trained athletes. \nMedications such as beta-blockers can cause it without serious sequelae. Symptomatic \nsinus bradycardia from sinus node disease can be from degeneration of the node or \nfrom ischemia. \n• More serious types of bradycardia  can be from Mobitz type II second-degree heart \nblock and third-degree (complete) heart block. These can occur secondary to ischemic \ndamage of the AV node. Other causes are myocarditis, infiltrative disease, such as \namyloidosis or sarcoidosis, or neoplasms.\nClinical presentation can range from the lifelong absence of symptoms to severe symptoms of \nhypotension and decreased cardiac output. Diagnosis is made with EKG.Note\nPatients with A-fib and \nthyrotoxicosis always get \nanticoagulation until euthyroid \nand back in NSR.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   383 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

In ingestion of an unknown type, perform a urine \nor blood toxicology screen, but do not delay the administration of antidotes, charcoal, or gas -\ntric emptying (rarely needed). \n• Activated charcoal  (mainstay of therapy). Give every 2–4 hours to block further \nabsorption of the substance and accelerate the removal of toxins already absorbed by \nthe body. Charcoal is safe for all patients. \n• Induced vomiting.  Ipecac can be used only within 1–2 hours after ingestion, so it has \nno use in the hospital setting. Very few people arrive within the first hour. Therefore, \nit is more useful for ingestions in the home, where the time period since ingestion is \nshort and there are no other effective modalities available. Ipecac is never recom -\nmended for children.\n• Lavage.  Gastric emptying with a large-bore (37–42 French) oropharyngeal hose (e.g., \nEwald tube) should be used only in those with an altered mental status because of \n possible aspiration. Lavage should therefore be preceded by endotracheal intubation in \nmost cases. The exact indications for lavage are not clear, but the contraindications are \nvery clear. \n –Useful only within the first hour after ingestion, and thus rarely used \n –Decreases absorption by 52% at 5 min, 26% at 30 min, and 16% at 60 min \n –Contraindicated with the ingestion of caustic substances such as acid or alkalis\n• Whole bowel irrigation.  For large-volume pill ingestion where the pills can be seen \non an x-ray, whole bowel irrigation can be effective. A gastric tube is placed and \nhigh-volume (1–2 liters per hour) GoLYTELY (polyethylene glycol) is administered \nuntil the bowel movements run clear. \n• Dialysis.  Dialysis is rarely necessary because the time delay to its initiation limits its \nefficacy. If it is necessary, hemodialysis is 20x more efficacious at removing drugs from \nthe body than peritoneal dialysis. Dialysis is the best option when there are profoundly \nserious symptoms such as coma, hypotension, or apnea, especially when renal or hepatic \nfailure limits the usual means of excreting substances from the body. \n• Cathartics.  Cathartics are useful when used with charcoal administration. Otherwise, \nthey are almost never helpful. When cathartics appear in an exam question, they are \ngenerally the wrong answer. \n• Forced diuresis.  Alkaline diuresis can help eliminate salicylates and phenobarbital. \nOtherwise, simply making the patient urinate in high volumes is not helpful. Except for \nsalicylates and phenobarbital, forced diuresis is generally the wrong answer in an exam \nqueston. \n• Naloxone/ dextrose/thiamine.  These agents should be given first to anyone presenting \nwith altered mental status or coma. They are particularly useful when a toxin ingestion \nproduces confusion. Naloxone has almost no adverse effects and works instantly; because \nof its rapid response, it is both therapeutic and diagnostic. Dextrose is also very effective \nat preventing permanent brain damage from hypoglycemia. It does not matter whether \nthe dextrose or thiamine is given first.

It is used to screen for drug abuse, monitor a sub -\nstance abuse problem, and evaluate drug intoxication for overdose.\n• The best initial test  in toxicology screen is the urine immunoassay  (qualitative test). \nTypically screened are alcohol, cocaine, PCP, amphetamines, and cannabinoids.\n• The confirmatory test  is gas chromatography/mass spectrometry , which  provides \nqualitative analysis and allows identification of the specific drug or its metabolites.\nToxicology screen must be done within a certain amount of time after the drug is taken, or \nwhile metabolites can still be detected in the body.

He complains of vomiting and \nright upper quadrant pain. Bilirubin, AST, and prothrombin time are all elevated. \nAcetaminophen is one of the few toxins about which precise toxicity levels are known; the \ningestion of ~ 140 mg per kg is usually sufficient to cause serious toxicity . In other words, in \nan average-sized, 70-kg (154-lb) person, ~7–10 grams is enough to produce toxicity, and \nfatalities can occur >12–15 grams. In those with liver disease or concomitant alcohol abuse \nand thus depleted glutathione stores, the hepatotoxic dose is less (4 grams/day).Note\nAcetaminophen is rapidly and \ncompletely absorbed from the \nGI tract. Serum concentration \ncan peak in 2 hours after oral \ningestion at a therapeutic dose.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   388 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

A clear history of a large volume of acetaminophen ingestion is initially sufficient \nto establish a diagnosis that warrants therapy with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Starting at 4 hours \nafter ingestion, when most of the drug has been absorbed, drug levels are reliable. A nomo-\ngram based on relating the drug level to the time of ingestion is necessary to determine who \nwill develop toxicity. In other words, a level by itself is not enough to determine who will \ndevelop toxicity. A certain level at 5–6 hours may not be toxic, but the same level at 10–12 \nhours post-ingestion may lead to the development of liver failure.\n• Elevated AST is more common than elevated ALT. If a patient is known for alcohol \nabuse and presents with AST and ALT >1,000 U/L, the diagnosis is more likely to be \nacetaminophen toxicity than alcoholic hepatitis. Give NAC in such cases. \n• Elevated bilirubin and prothrombin time indicate severe toxicity and hepatic necrosis. \nStudies show that NAC administration within the first 8 hours of severe drug poison -\ning improves liver microcirculation and prevents the need for liver transplant.\nTreatment.  NAC is preferably given within 8 hours of ingestion, when it is most effective. If >24 \nhours has elapsed since ingestion, there is no specific therapy which can prevent or reverse the \ntoxicity, but always  still give NAC . Give activated charcoal in repeated doses. Do not use gastric \nemptying because it will delay the administration of NAC as a specific antidote.\nALCOHOLS\nAt the opera, you go to see the Three Tenors, who exhibit confusion, ataxia, lethargy, \ndrowsiness, and slurred speech; which is to say, you have really gone to see the \nThree Drunken  Tenors. How would you distinguish between the tenors drunk on \nmethanol or ethylene glycol from those drunk on simple ethanol?\nMethanol ( wood alcohol) is found in paint thinner, sterno, photocopier fluid, solvents, and \nwindshield washer solution. Ethylene glycol  is found in automotive antifreeze. All of the \nalcohols are metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase, which then metabolizes methanol to \nformaldehyde and formic acid. Ethylene glycol is metabolized partially to oxalic acid and \noxalate, which leads to kidney damage.Note\nUnlike most other cases of \nhepatitis, acetaminophen-\ninduced hepatitis is acute in \nonset, progresses rapidly and \ncharacterized by marked \nelevation of plasma \naminotransferases (often \n>3,000 IU/L) and associated \nwith a rise in PT/INR.\nNote\nNAC is now used for non-\nacetaminophen drug-induced \nliver injury, e.g., amoxicillin/\nclavulanate.

Determining specific levels of each alcohol is the most specific test. \n• Methanol and ethylene glycol will be characterized by an increased serum osmolar \ngap and metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. \n• Ethylene glycol is characterized by oxalate crystals in the urine, increasing BUN/\ncreatinine, or urine fluorescence (add fluorescein to the urine and observe with \nultraviolet Wood’s lamp). Hypocalcemia may also be present.\n• Isopropyl alcohol will produce an osmolar gap without an increased anion gap.\nTreatment.  Fomepizole (alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor) is the drug of choice; it inhibits the \nproduction of toxic metabolites without leading to intoxication. Consider dialysis for those with \nsevere anion gap metabolic acidosis or signs of end-organ damage (coma, seizures, renal failure).\nIn the past, methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication were treated with ethanol infusion (to \nprevent the production of the toxic metabolites), followed by hemodialysis to remove the \nsubstance from the body. \nCARBON MONOXIDE\nYou are the chief resident at a metropolitan training program at the time of a fire at \na large office building.

Among them is a 68-year-old man with a history \nof aortic stenosis who had to walk down 90 flights of stairs. What is the most \nimportant initial test for this man?\nPoisoning with carbon monoxide (CO) occurs by exposure to burning materials (gasoline, \nwood, natural gas) and by entrapment in fires and smoke inhalation. CO itself is odorless and \ntasteless. CO poisoning is common, potentially fatal, and underdiagnosed because of its non -\nspecific clinical presentation.\n• CO bin ds to hemoglobin 200x more avidly than oxygen. \n• Carboxyhemoglobin decreases release of oxygen to tissues and inhibits mitochondria, \nresulting in tissue hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism (similar to what would occur \nwith anemia).\nClinical Presentation.  \n• Pulmonary symptoms include dyspnea, tachypnea, and shortness of breath. \n• Cardiac symptoms include chest pain, arrhythmia, and hypotension.Note\nMethanol, ethylene glycol, and \nisopropyl alcohol ingestion will \nall result in an osmolar gap, \nusually >25 mOsm.\nNote\nCharcoal will not inhibit the \nabsorption of alcohols. Do not \nuse.\nNote\nLow levels of CO poisoning \nare present in most tobacco \nsmokers.Note\nIn Northern climates, space \nheaters during wintertime are \na common cause of carbon \nmonoxide poisoning.

Give hyperbaric oxygen in severe cases: COHb >25% (pregnant women >15%); \nmyocardial ischemia; EKG changes; CNS abnormalities other than headache or chest pain.\nIn room air, carbon monoxide has a half-life of 4–6 hours, which decreases to 40–80 minutes \non 100% oxygen and to 15–30 minutes with hyperbaric oxygen.\nCAUSTICS/CORROSIVES\nCaustics/corrosives are the oral ingestion, inhalation, or cutaneous or ocular contact with \nvarious corrosive substances. The most common household acids  are various toilet, drain, \nswimming pool, and metal cleaners. The most common alkali  ingestions or exposures are \nfrom liquid and crystalline lye, dishwasher detergent, hair relaxer, and oven cleaner. The most \ncommon serious injury is from the oral ingestion of liquid drain cleaner.\nSymptoms from ingestion injury include the following:\n• Oral pain\n• Drooling\n• Odynophagia\n• Abdominal pain\n• Possible esophageal injury with subsequent stricture formation (from either acid or \nalkali ingestion)\n• Possible gastric perforation\nIn most circumstances, alkali exposures are more serious than acid exposures , since alkaline \nsubstances are more destructive to tissues.\nThe history of exposure with subsequent characteristic injury is sufficient to establish the \ndiagnosis. Upper endoscopy is critical for determining the extent of the injury.Note\nCO poisoning initially presents \njust like hypoglycemia. If \nfingerstick glucose is normal, \nthat should raise your \nsuspicions.\nNote\nCorrosive  refers to any \nchemical that will dissolve the \nstructure of an object. They \ncan be acids or bases, \nmeaning when they come into \ncontact with a surface, the \nsurface deteriorates.\nCaustic  is sometimes used as \na synonym for corrosive but \nreally only refers to strong \nbases, not acids.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   391 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

Management of both acid and alkali caustic ingestions is essentially the same. \n• Wash out the mouth immediately with large volumes of cold water. \n• Irrigate ocular exposures with large volumes of saline or water, followed by fluores -\ncein staining to determine if there is significant corneal injury. \n• Do not induce emesis  with acid or alkaline ingestion because it can worsen the injury. \nSimply give water. \n• Do not try to neutralize the acid with a base or a base with an acid because a heat-\nproducing reaction can occur, which would destroy more tissue. \n• Charcoal is not useful, nor are steroids or prophylactic antibiotics.\nDRUGS OF ABUSE\nOpiates\nOpiate toxicity is predominantly respiratory related, via depressant effects upon the  respiratory \ncenters in the brain stem. Death can occur through acute respiratory acidosis. In addition to \ntheir analgesic and euphoric effects, opiates also cause pupillary constriction, constipation, \nbradycardia, hypothermia, and hypotension. \nOpiates can be rapidly reversed by naloxone. Since opioids decrease gastric emptying by \nrelaxation of smooth muscle, gastric lavage may be used in cases of overdose with oral agents.\nAlthough withdrawal of opiates is uncomfortable, it is not fatal. It is usually treated with \nmethadone or buprenorphine. Opiate withdrawal symptoms are the following.\n• 3–4 hours : fear, anxiety, drug craving\n• 8–14 hours : insomnia, yawning, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, anxiety\n• 1–3 days : tremor, muscle spasms, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, chills, piloerection\nCocaine\nCocaine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and other catecholamines at the synapse. This \nleads to a wide variety of euphoric and toxic effects. Amphetamines work in a similar way but \nare less likely to produce severe toxicity or death. Severe toxicity from cocaine is far more likely \nwith smoked (“crack”) or injected cocaine rather than snorted (inhaled).\nClinical Presentation.  Toxic effects of cocaine are related to a very significant alpha-adrener -\ngic stimulatory effect, resulting in the following (may lead to death):\n• Very high BP\n• Hemorrhagic stroke\n• Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n• Myocardial infarction\n• Arrhythmia\n• Seizures \n• Metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and hyperthermia in some cases\n• Pulmonary edema (specific to smoked cocaine)Note\nCorrosives/caustics  are \nimmediately dangerous to \ntissues they contact, while \npoisons  may have systemic \neffects which require time to \nbe evident.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   392 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

Combined alpha/beta agents such as labetalol or \nalpha-blockers such as phentolamine are useful to control hypertension. Avoid pure beta-\nblockers because they lead to unopposed alpha stimulatory effects. \nCocaine withdrawal can cause depression as a result of the norepinephrine depletion. There is \nlimited physiologic withdrawal from cocaine.\nBenzodiazepines\nBenzodiazepines (BZDs) produce somnolence, dysarthria, ataxia, and stupor. Very infre-\nquently, they lead to death from respiratory depression; most deaths are associated with \nethanol or barbiturate ingestion.\nPatients receiving prolonged parenteral administration of BZDs are at risk for propylene \nglycol poisoning (used in parenteral formulations of diazepam and lorazepam). Rarely, \nthis may cause hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias, lactic acidosis, seizures, or coma.\nTreatment.  Good supportive care and monitoring are the foundation of treatment. As with \nany overdose, the first step is to stabilize the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation.\n• Flumazenil is a specific antidote for BZD poisoning, although its use in acute BZD \noverdose is controversial.\n• In long-term BZD users, flumazenil may precipitate withdrawal and seizures.\n• In BZD use for a medical condition, flumazenil may exacerbate the condition.\nBZD withdrawal can be similar to the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Although rare, deaths \nhave been reported from severe withdrawal. The recommendation for treatment of severe \nforms of withdrawal is the administrations of BZDs.\nBarbiturates\nBarbiturates are a class of drugs with various long- and short-acting agents. Massive overdose \ncan result in death from respiratory depression or CNS depression. \n• Can cause hypothermia, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and loss of corneal reflexes\n• Could result in a coma simulating brain death \n• May lead to absent EEG activity\n• Withdrawal may result in seizures similar to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal\n• Have no specific antidote, although urinary excretion of phenobarbital can be increased \nwith the use of bicarbonate (similar to treatment for salicylate intoxication)\nHallucinogens\nHallucinogens include a variety of agents such as marijuana, LSD, mescaline, peyote, and psilocy -\nbin. Although they may cause delirium and bizarre behavior, the adverse effects are often limited \nto their anticholinergic effects: flushed skin, dry mouth, dilated pupils, and urinary retention. \nThe only hallucinogen associated with a potentially fatal outcome is the artificially created, \ndissociative, anesthetic phencyclidine ( PCP  or “angel dust”), which may cause seizures. \nTreatment for severe hallucinogen intoxication is with benzodiazepines.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   393 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

Although effective, it has a narrow therapeutic window and is associated with toxicity. \nThere are 2 main types:\n• In acute poisoning , patients do not have a lithium burden \n –Symptoms are primarily GI, with nausea, vomiting, cramping, and possible \ndiarrhea\n –Progression can involve neuromuscular signs: tremulousness, dystonia, hyperre -\nflexia, and ataxia\n –Most common electrocardiographic finding is T-wave flattening\n• In chronic poisoning , patients have a large body burden of lithium \n –Symptoms are primarily neurologic, with mental status often altered\n –Progression can lead to coma and seizures if diagnosis is unrecognized\n –May be difficult to treat\n –Usually precipitated by introduction of new medication which may impair renal \nfunction or cause hypovolemic state\nThree major drug classes have been identified as potential precipitants of lithium toxicity :\n• Diuretics which promote renal sodium wasting\n• ACE inhibitors which reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and enhance the tubular \nreabsorption of lithium\n• NSAIDs which reduce the GFR and interrupt renal prostaglandin synthesis\nSystemic effects  include renal toxicity:\n• Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (most severe manifestation)\n• Impaired sodium and water absorption, caused by inhibition of action of antidiuretic \nhormone on distal renal tubule\n• Renal tubular acidosis, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and nephrotic syndrome\nThe most common endocrine disorder secondary to chronic toxicity is hypothyroidism. \nLithium is taken up by thyroid cells and blocks thyroid hormone release from thyroglobulin, \nwhich inhibits adenylate cyclase and prevents TSH from activating thyroid cells via the TSH \nreceptor. Acute exposure to lithium can cause leukocytosis, whereas chronic exposure can \nproduce aplastic anemia.\nElevated lithium in the blood will confirm toxicity, although levels may not correlate with \nclinical symptoms. Serial levels may be warranted in cases of sustained-release tablets.\nTreatment.  Supportive therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Gastric lavage may be attempted \nif patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion.\n• Airway protection is crucial due to emesis and risk of aspiration. \n• Seizures can be controlled with BZDs, phenobarbital, or propofol. \n• Fluid therapy is crucial to restore GFR, normalize urine output, and enhance lithium \nclearance.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   395 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

Thus, hemodialysis is indicated for patients who have renal failure (and \nunable to eliminate lithium) and patients who cannot tolerate hydration (e.g., those with CHF, \nliver disease, or severe toxicity meaning neurologic symptoms >4 m/Eq/L).\nLithium is a monovalent cation that does not bind to charcoal, so activated charcoal has no role.\nSALICYLATES\nAn older woman with osteoarthritis comes to the emergency department with \ndyspnea, intractable nausea, vomiting, and tinnitus. She is fully alert and able to \ngive a good history. Her only other problem is hypertension. She is on a wide \nvariety of medications to reduce her pain. Her husband says she was in so much \npain lately that she took half a bottle of extra pills 30 minutes ago.\nSalicylate intoxication results from the ingestion of a large amount of aspirin and other \nsalicylate-containing medications, resulting in a complex, systemic toxicity.\nSalicylates are complex metabolic poisons. The most common presentation is GI distress such \nas nausea, vomiting, and gastritis. Tinnitus is one of the more specific complaints and is one of \nthe best ways to identify the case, so as to answer the question: “Which of the  following is the \nmost likely diagnosis?” \nSalicylates affect respiratory function in 2 ways: \n• Directly stimulate the respiratory centers in the brainstem to cause a centrally \nmediated hyperventilation and hyperpnea\n• Are directly toxic to the lungs themselves and can cause a noncardiogenic pulmonary \nedema similar to ARDS\nHyperthermia is possible. CNS toxicity such as confusion, coma, seizures, and encephalopathy \ncan also occur, with possible death. \nSalicylates also interfere with Krebs cycle and lead to a metabolic acidosis through the rever -\nsion to anaerobic glycolysis as a method of energy production in the body. In other words, \nsalicylates lead to significant lactic acid production with metabolic acidosis and elevated anion \ngap. This ultimately results in a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.\nThe most specific test for diagnosis is  aspirin level . \n• Suggestive findings are elevated anion gap with metabolic acidosis . However, \nrespiratory alkalosis may be the predominant defect, especially in early stages. Thus, \nblood gas can show low, high, or normal pH. \n• Elevated prothrombin time and hypoglycemia may occur. \n• Chest x-ray may be normal or show pulmonary edema.\nTreatment.  If the patient comes within 1 hour post-ingestion, attempt gastric decontamina-\ntion. Charcoal may be useful, as it is in many types of ingestion. The mainstay of therapy, \nhowever, is increasing urinary excretion by alkalinizing the urine and administering aggres-\nsive fluid resuscitation. When urinary pH rises, that will charge the salicylate molecule (a weak \nacid) and will block the reabsorption of the substance at the kidney tubule. \n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   396 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

The most common precipitating cause of digitalis toxicity is the \nreduction of potassium stores, often seen in patients with heart failure due to diuretic therapy \nor secondary hyperaldosteronism. Hypokalemia  predisposes to toxicity because potassium \nand digoxin bind to the same site on the sodium–potassium ATPase pump, leading to \nincreased intracellular calcium, thus leading to increased cardiac contractility. Drugs that have \nbeen implicated in digoxin toxicity include amiodarone, beta blockers, diltiazem, cyclosporine, \nmacrolide antibiotics, indomethacin, spironolactone, and furosemide.\nClinical Presentation.  GI symptoms are most common: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and \nanorexia. Neurologic and visual symptoms include blurred vision, color vision abnormality, \nhallucinations, and confusion. Cardiac disturbance is predominantly secondary to  arrhythmia.\nEKG abnormalities are common. Bradycardia, premature contractions, ventricular  tachycardia, \nand any other arrhythmia may be seen (paroxysmal atrial tachycardia is most common). \nHyperkalemia occurs acutely from inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase by digoxin.

He is stuporous with respiratory rate 7/min. EKG shows a wide \nQRS. What is the next step?\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are characterized by a number of anticholinergic and sodium \nchannel blocker side effects. This is the predominant cause of their cardiac and CNS toxicity. \nClinical Presentation . The most common adverse effects are anticholinergic -mediated \nfindings of dry mouth, tachycardia, dilated pupils, and flushed skin. A quick onset with rapid \ndeterioration is common. The most serious effects are cardiac dysrhythmia with  widening of \nthe QRS complex , resulting in ventricular tachycardia and first-degree  conduction blocks. \nCNS effects include altered mental status, confusion, and seizure. \nSerum drug levels are the most specific test for diagnosis, but EKG with abnormalities is more \nimportant to determine who will have serious toxicity. The EKG may be normal or show any \nrange of ventricular or atrial arrhythmias or conduction delays. \nTreatment.  TCA overdose has anticholinergic side effects, which include impaired peristalsis and \ndelayed gastric emptying. TCAs block sodium channels and can cause ventricular tachycardia.\n• Charcoal is the primary treatment in the acute setting. \n• Bicarbonate protects the heart from the TCAs .

Bicarbonate is not to increase urinary excretion (as opposed \nto the treatment of aspirin overdose). \nANTICHOLINERGIC POISONING\nA 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife with \nlethargy and confusion. She says that he has had a cold and has taken over-the-\ncounter cold preparations for the last few days. On examination he is confused \nand does not recognize his wife. His temperature is 39.2 C (102.5 F), pulse  \n130/min and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg. The skin is flushed, dry, and warm. \nThe eyes are dilated.\nAnticholinergic overdose may occur in any age group with high dose, but most commonly presents \nin the elderly. Anticholinergic drugs competitively inhibit binding of the neuro  transmitter acetyl -\ncholine to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and are commonly called “antimuscarinic agents. ” \nMuscarinic receptors are found on peripheral postganglionic cholinergic nerves in smooth muscle \n(intestinal, bronchial, and cardiac), in secretory glands (salivary and sweat), on the ciliary body of \nthe eye, and in the central nervous system. Anticholinergic agents do not antagonize the effects at \nnicotinic acetylcholine receptors, such as at the neuro-muscular junction.\nThe onset of anticholinergic toxicity varies depending on the particular toxin, but usually \noccurs within 1–2 hours of oral ingestion. Some drugs may take up to 12 hours to have an \neffect. Be aware with patients on psychotropic agents. \n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   398 16/05/19   11:15 AM",

The term does not \nimply a specific mechanism of injury. The injury can result in concussion, contusion, epidural \nhematoma, subdural hematoma, or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The specific injury can \nonly be determined with CT scan. \n• All forms of head trauma can result in headache, amnesia, and loss of consciousness. \nThe degree of amnesia is loosely associated with the degree of head trauma, i.e., the \nworse the trauma, the more memory one loses. \n• Memory loss starts from the time of injury and stretches both forward  (anterograde , \nin which one doesn’t remember events since the time of the injury) and backward ( ret-\nrograde , in which one forgets past events). \n –Retrograde amnesia (more common) starts from the time of the injury and moves \nfurther back in time depending on the severity of the injury.

Vasospasm after the bleed results in hypoperfusion to portions of the brain \nparenchyma and the development of stroke. Rebleeding occurs when the clot falls off of the \noriginal site of bleeding. Up to half of the people who rebleed will die. Hydrocephalus occurs \nwhen the blood cells clog up the arachnoid granulations through which CSF normally drains. \nDiagnosis.  The initial test is the CT scan, which is more sensitive than MRI for the diagnosis \nof SAH. The CT, done without contrast, has a sensitivity of 90–95% within the first 24 hours \nafter the onset of the bleed. With time, the diagnostic sensitivity of the CT actually diminishes, \nas the red cells within the CSF hemolyze and are resorbed and converted into the yellowish \ncoloring (described on CSF examination as xanthochromia) . \n• If the initial CT is normal and SAH is still suspected, do a lumbar puncture . The \nlumbar puncture is the most sensitive diagnostic test, i.e., an absence of red cells and \nxanthochromia on lumbar puncture essentially excludes an SAH. Xanthochromia is \ndue to lysis of RBCs and formation of bilirubin (straw-colored CSF). Xanthochromia \nneeds 4–6 hours to develop. \n• Angiography is used to determine the specific anatomic site of the vascular defect and \nthe site of the bleed. EKG abnormalities such as inverted or enlarged T-waves are often \nassociated with the development of SAH, and are not a cause for alarm.\nTreatment.  Initial steps are to maintain systolic BP at 110–160 mm Hg. Pressure higher than \nthat can provoke more bleeding, while pressure lower can provoke cerebral ischemia through \nhypoperfusion (given the increased intracranial pressure). \n• Use nimodipine, a calcium-channel antagonist, to lower the risk of spasm in the blood \nvessel, thus lowering the risk of subsequent stroke. \n• Do angiography  to determine the anatomic site that will need catheter or surgical \ncorrection. It is important to perform this so that surgical correction (usually with \nembolization or clipping of the AVM) can occur before rebleeding develops. If \nhydrocephalus occurs, then shunting will be needed. Embolization is superior to \nsurgical clipping.\nBURNS\nA 32-year-old fireman is caught in a fire and briefly trapped under a burning \nstaircase.

This leaves patients with third-degree \nburns insensate; any pain they perceive is from surrounding structures where pain \nreceptors are intact.\nAlthough not apparent at first, respiratory injury can be the most life-threatening injury. \n• Soot in the mouth or nose, stridor, wheezing, altered mental status, burned nasal \nhairs, and burns involving closed spaces are all clues to impending pulmonary and \nlaryngeal edema. \n• Shock occurs not only from direct skin loss but also from release of a host of media -\ntors that cause diffuse capillary leak  for the first 18–24 hours. Serious capillary leak \noccurs when the percentage of serious body surface area burn >20–25%.\nClinical Presentation.  Altered mental status, dyspnea, headache, and chest pain are clues to \nsevere carbon monoxide poisoning. Laryngeal edema can result in stridor, hoarseness, and \ndyspnea. Soot in the nose and mouth can imply impending airway compromise. \nThe “ Rule of Nines ” is used to determine the body surface area that has been burned, and \nthus assess fluid resuscitation needs:\n• Head and arms : 9% each\n• Chest, back, and legs : 18% each \n• Patchy burns can be estimated by using one hand’s width as an estimate of 1% of body \nsurface area burned. \n• Circumferential burns are critical in the assessment because as they heal, they tighten \nand cut off circulation, leading to limb compromise and the need for escharotomy.\nDiagnosis.  Besides the obvious burn, carboxyhemoglobin levels are essential in severe burns. \nSevere burns are defined as combined second- and third-degree burns >20% in adults or >10% in \nthe very old or very young or third-degree burns >5% of body surface area (BSA). Chest x-ray \nand bronchoscopy help determine the exact extent of respiratory injury when it is uncertain. \nBronchoscopy can reveal severe thermal injury to the lungs even when the initial chest film is \nnormal. Foley catheter placement helps determine the adequacy of fluid resuscitation.\nTreatment.  \n• If patient has signs of severe respiratory injury, the first step is to intubate before more \nsevere laryngeal edema can occur and make the intubation difficult. \n• If carboxyhemoglobin level is significantly elevated (>5–10%), administer 100% oxygen. \n• Fluid resuscitation over the first 24 hours is based on a formula of 4 mL per % BSA \nburned per kg. Use second- and third- degree burns in your calculation.\n –Use Ringer’s lactate as the preferred fluid; give 50% of the fluid in the first 8 hours, \n25% in the second 8 hours, and 25% in the final 8 hours.

Exertional  disorders vary from mild cramps to \nmore severe heat exhaustion to potentially lethal heat stroke. Nonexertional  disorders are \nmalignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and serotonin syndrome.\nExertional Disorders\n• Heat cramps  (mild exertional disorder) can happen to any healthy person who \ndevelops fluid and electrolyte depletion\n –Patient develops painful muscular contractions lasting a few minutes, with muscle \ntenderness present. Body temperature is normal.\n –Patient is able to sweat. There are no neurologic abnormalities.\n –Treatment is rest, oral rehydration, and salt replacement.\n• Heat exhaustion (more severe)\n –Patient is weaker with more systemic symptoms. Body temperature may be slightly \nelevated.\n –Patient is able to sweat and remove heat from the body. There may be mild neuro -\nlogic symptoms such as headache, nausea, and anxiety, but severe confusion is rare.\n –Death is very unlikely, but the disorder can progress to heat stroke if not treated. \n –Treatment is oral fluid and electrolyte replacement. For severe weakness, IV \nhydration may be needed.\n• Heat stroke  (very severe and potentially life-threatening)\n –Patient has lost the ability to remove heat from the body because of an impaired \nability to sweat; 50% of patients retain some capacity to sweat but in insufficient \namounts to keep up with heat generation. \n –Body temperature may become severely elevated (>41C), resulting in confusion, \ndisorientation, nausea, blurred vision, and seizures. \n –Numerous lab abnormalities may occur, including hemoconcentration, rhabdomy -\nolysis, and elevated BUN, creatinine, and white cell count.\n –Anuria, DIC, and lactic acidosis may develop.\n –Treatment for non-exertional heat stroke  is IV fluid replacement and external \nevaporative cooling of the body (place in cool environment and spray with water, \nthen fan to evaporate the fluid). Treatment for young athletes with exertional heat \nstroke  is immersion in ice water. In the elderly, chlorpromazine and diazepam can \nbe used to control shivering.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   408 16/05/19   11:16 AM",
    "page_416": "Chapter 10   ●  Emergency Medicine\n409\nNonexertional Disorders\n• Malignant hyperthermia  occurs as an idiosyncratic reaction to an anesthetic such as \nhalothane or succinylcholine. Virtually any anesthetic may cause it. \n –Rhabdomyolysis may develop.\n –Treatment is dantrolene, which directly relaxes muscles by inhibiting calcium \nrelease from the sarcoplasmic reticulum,\n• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome  occurs an idiosyncratic reaction to a phenothiazine or \nbutyrophenone such as haloperidol. It is postulated that dopamine blockade or depletion \ncan lead to abnormal regulation of body temperature and Parkinsonian features.\n –Muscular rigidity and rhabdomyolysis may occur; also, altered mental status, \nmuscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction\n –Treatment, besides stopping the drug, is bromocriptine and dantrolene.\n• Serotonin syndrome  (common and potentially life-threatening) is a drug reaction \nthat often occurs when 2 medications affecting the body’s level of serotonin are taken \ntogether, such as SSRI, SNRI, meperidine and tramadol.\n –Symptoms can range from mild to severe: agitation, confusion, muscle rigidity, and \nheavy sweating\n –No single test can confirm serotonin syndrome and a number of other conditions \nhave similar  symptoms \n –Treatment is supportive care and cyproheptadine (serotonin antagonis)\nHYPOTHERMIA\nHypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can \nproduce heat, causing a dangerously low core body temperature <35 C (normal 37 C). Core \ntemperature is measured with a rectal probe or through the esophagus. It is often seen in \nassociation with alcohol intoxication, particularly in the elderly.\nSevere hypothermia is core temperature <30 C. \nClinical Presentation . Symptoms of severe hypothermia commonly relate to the central nervous \nsystem. Lethargy, confusion, and weakness may occur. Death is most commonly a result of arrhyth -\nmia (Osborne wave or J wave), from the effect of the cold on altering cardiac conduction. Other \ncomplications include metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis, kidney injury, and hyperkalemia.\nDiagnosis.  The EKG can show a wide variety of serious arrhythmias, including ventricular \nfibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. The most characteristic finding is an elevated J-point, \nknown as Osborne waves. J-wave elevation may mimic ST-segment elevation.\nTreatment.  Most patients respond well to common-sense treatment such as a warm bed, bath, \nand heated blanket. For very severe cases, use warmed IV fluid or humidified oxygen. Caution, \nthough, because overly rapid rewarming can cause arrhythmias; if life-threatening arrhythmias \noccur, it is important to continue resuscitative efforts until body temperature >35 C . If the \npatient is cold but not shivering, active measures should be used: \nActive external rewarming:  only to truncal areas; warm blankets; heat lamps; hot-water bottles\nActive internal rewarming:  warm IVFs (45 C), warm humidified oxygen (45 C), warmed \ngastric lavage via NGT, warmed hemodialysis\nHypothermia is one of the few times in which a patient can be resuscitated from pulselessness \nbeyond the usual 10 minutes of efforts.Note\nHypothermia must be worked \nup for precipitant factors:\n• Hypoglycemia (most \ncommon cause)\n• Hypothyroidism\n• Sepsis\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   409 16/05/19   11:16 AM",

Longer exposures give worse injury. \nNonionizing radiation  is less destructive to tissue and causes injury primarily as burns. \nExamples include infrared, ultraviolet, and microwave radiation.\nClinical Presentation.  To give a sense of scale, mortality is almost zero with <2 Gy (or Sv) of \nexposure. This rises almost to 100% mortality with >10 Gy (or Sv). (10 Gy = 1,000 rad.)\nAny cell can be damaged by ionizing radiation, but the more rapidly the cell divides, the more \nvulnerable it is to radiation. This is because more DNA damage can be done during the time of \ndivision.\nCommon sites of radiation injury include the following:\n• Bone marrow : As little as 2–3 Gy (200–300 rad) can depress lymphocyte count. Neutro -\nphils are the next most sensitive cell, while erythrocytes are the least sensitive. \n –Long-term, leukemia is the earliest and most common cause of cancer from \nradiation exposure. \n –Thrombocytopenia can result in death from bleeding. \n –Overall, infection  and  bleeding  from depressed bone marrow function are the \nmost common causes of death in acute exposure.\n• Gonads : 2−3 grays result in temporary aspermatogenesis, while 4−5 grays can make \nmen permanently sterile. Testes are more sensitive than ovaries.\n• GI: Nausea and vomiting are the most common early symptoms of radiation exposure \n(50% of cases with 2 Gy (200 rad) exposure and 100% of patients with >3 Gy expo -\nsure). Also, the rapidly reproducing intestinal lining ulcerates, leading to bleeding and \ninfection later.\n• Other common sites of radiation injury : the skin, salivary glands, respiratory \nepithelium, and thyroid glands\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   410 16/05/19   11:16 AM",

It is a major cause of disability \nand death, particularly in children. At least 35% of survivors sustain moderate-to-severe neu -\nrologic sequelae.\n• Alcohol and drug use are strongly associated with an increased risk of death by \ndrowning. \n• Muscular exhaustion, head and spinal trauma, or acute myocardial infarction are \npredispositions to drowning and near drowning. \n• 10−20 percent of drowning victims may have suffered dry drowning, in that there is \nno water aspirated into the lungs. Dry drowning is secondary to laryngospasm.\nDrowning from aspiration of water can be divided into 2 types:\n• Freshwater  (hypotonic) alters pulmonary surfactant, resulting in un stable alveoli \nwhich then collapse. \n –The hypotonic water is absorbed into the body, leading to  acute hypervolemia, \nhemodilution, and intravascular hemolysis.  \n –At autopsy, the lungs may contain little water.\n• Seawater (hypertonic) draws water out of the body into the lung, causing systemic \nhypovolemia and hemoconcentration .\n –The lungs become even more heavy and fluid-filled because the surfactant is \nessentially washed out.\nPresentation.  Only the presentation of near drowning is important to discuss because drowned \nvictims are dead. Presentation can vary from coma to agitation. Cyanosis, coughing, and signs of \npulmonary edema, such as tachypnea, tachycardia, and blood-tinged sputum are common. Rales \nand rhonchi can be found on the exam. Hypothermia is also common.\nLaboratory Findings.  Arterial blood gases show hypoxia and hypercarbia, as well as metabolic \nacidosis from anaerobic metabolism. Hyperkalemia may be present if there is significant \nhemolysis. Renal insufficiency on the basis of hypoxia is a rare finding.\nTreatment.  The first task is to remove the patient from the water and do ABCs (airway/\nbreathing/circulation) of resuscitation.\n• Endotracheal intubation as needed\n• Supplemental oxygenNote\nNear drowning  is survival \nafter immersion, at least for \nsome time. Morbidity is high \nand death may occur later. \nThe exact definition is still the \ntopic of much debate.\nDrowning  is defined as death \nwithin 24 hours after \nsubmersion in water.\nNote\nYoung children are more likely \nto drown in freshwater (e.g., \nswimming pool) than in \nseawater.\n10_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch10.indd   411 16/05/19   11:16 AM",

Even if the patient appears comfortable initially, observe for \n24 hours because ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) may develop as a late finding.\nThe following treatments do not help and may be harmful :\n• Abdominal thrusts  may lead to aspiration of gastric contents.\n• Antibiotics  are indicated only if pneumonia develops.\n• Steroids  have no benefit.\nANAPHYLAXIS\nAnaphylaxis is a syndrome of histaminergic release in which there are signs of severe injury \nsuch as urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory compromise. As an \nidiosyncratic reaction, patients can develop anaphylaxis from any medication, food, insect \nbite, or antigenic substance entering the body by oral or parenteral route. \n• Penicillin, phenytoin, contrast agents, and allopurinol allergy are common \n• Chocolate, peanuts, and strawberries are common\n• Bee stings are common\nClinical Presentation.  Mild symptoms include a rash known as “hives. ” More severe symp-\ntoms include dyspnea, stridor, tachycardia, hypotension, and hemodynamic collapse.\nTreatment. Treatment is epinephrine (intramuscular or IV) and inhaled albuterol. \nVENOMOUS BITES AND STINGS\nCat and Dog Bites\nDog bites (most common bites in United States) are usually ripping and tearing in nature, \nwhereas cat bites are usually a puncture wound. \nClinical Presentation.  Infection is more likely in patients with a delay in treatment, extremes \nof age and extremity injuries. Infections are most often polymicrobial. \n• Cat bites are highly associated with Pasteurella multocida .\n• Dog bites are associated with Pasteurella, Eikenella , hemolytic streptococci , Staph \naureus , and Capnocytophaga canimorsus .\nTreatment.  Treatment is exploration, debridement, irrigation, and proper wound care. If \nprophylactic antibiotics are indicated, the drug of choice is amoxicillin and clavulanate (with \npenicillin-allergy, use a combination of clindamycin or metronidazole plus ciprofloxacin or \ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline).

    "page_423": "416\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nSpinal cord compression is an acute syndrome of back pain, associated with compression of \nthe spinal cord. It is considered a neurologic emergency. Common causes include cancer \n(lymphoma; multiple myeloma; carcinoma of prostate, lung, breast, kidney, colon), herniated \ndisk, epidural abscess, hematoma, and trauma (cause of acute cases).\nPatients commonly present with insidious onset of mild sensory disturbance, lower extremity \nweakness, and/or sphincter or sexual dysfunction. The earliest symptom is almost always pain \n(which may be intensified by actions that increase intrathoracic and thus cerebral  \nspinal fluid pressure). \nDiagnosis of acute spinal cord compression has to be suspected on the basis of the history \nand neurologic exam ; that is essential for instituting appropriate therapy early in the course \nof the disease. Cancer, fever, or bowel/bladder incontinence/retention in the clinical history \nwould strongly suggest the possibility of acute spinal cord compression. Also,  neurologic \nexam will show:\n• Dermatomal sensory level with bilateral lower extremity weakness\n• Increased lower extremity muscle tone\n• Upper motor neuron signs below the level of compression\nThe thoracic cord  is the most common site of compression (70%) because the spinal cord is \nnarrowest at that point. Symptoms may progress quickly.\nDiagnosis.  Plain x-ray is abnormal in the far majority of cases. They are rarely done. The diagnos -\ntic test of choice is MRI of the spine; when that is contraindicated, do a CT myelogram. \nTreatment.  Once the diagnosis is suspected, start high-dose dexamethasone immediately. \nAfter the specific etiology is identified more clearly by MRI, initiate specific therapy: \n• For a radiosensitive tumor such as lymphoma or multiple myeloma, start radiation \ntherapy as soon as possible. \n• For herniated disk, epidural abscess, or hematoma, start surgical decompression.\nPrognosis depends mainly on the functional status of the patient at the time of presentation. \nUp to 80% of patients who are initially able to ambulate retain that ability after treatment. Only \n5% of patients without antigravity leg strength are able to ambulate after treatment.\nSYRINGOMYELIA\nSyringomyelia is cavitation of the spinal cord. It occurs as communicating (with the CSF \npathways) or noncommunicating.  Communicating syringomyeli a is usually  associated with \nthe congenital Arnold Chiari malformation.  Noncommunicating  syringomyelia  is typically \nsecondary to trauma or tumors of the spinal cord.\nIn the cervical vertebrae of both gray and white matter, there is typically sensory dissociation \nwith impaired pain and temperature and intact sensation to light touch. The loss of pain and \ntemperature occurs in a cape-like distribution across the neck and arms. There is sparing of \ntactile sensation, position, and vibratory sense. Reflexes are lost.\nAs the lesion enlarges, there may be lower motor neuron manifestations at the level of the \nlesion with upper motor neuron signs below the lesion. Cavitation most commonly occurs at \nthe level of the cervical cord. MRI is the most accurate diagnostic test. Treatment is surgical, \nbut often unsatisfactory.\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   416 16/05/19   11:16 AM",

Noncontrast CT is the most sensitive test for detecting \nblood in the brain. CT is often negative for ischemia within the first 48 hours after symptom onset; \ndiffusion-weighted MRI is the most accurate test for detecting cerebral ischemia.\nDiagnostic workup for acute ischemic stroke involves searching for embolic sources (echocar -\ndiogram, carotid duplex, and 24-hour Holter monitor). Also consider a workup for inherited \nhypercoagulability. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is associated with EKG abnormalities such as \nischemia or inverted T-waves, called cerebral T-waves. A “bubble study” is done on the echocar -\ndiogram to detect the presence of a patent foramen ovale or other cardiac defect.\nTreatment.  Tissue plasminogen activator is given if the patient presents within 3 hours of \nsymptom onset. Contraindications for use of tissue plasminogen activator include:\n• Stroke or serious head trauma within 3 months \n• Hemorrhage (GI or GU) within 21 days\n• Surgery within 14 days \n• History of intracranial hemorrhage\n• BP >185/110 mm Hg\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   420 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

That is because of the increased \nrisk of bleeding. Any benefit is offset by adverse events associated with treatment. For every \nstroke prevented, one intracranial hemorrhage is caused.\n• Antiplatelet therapy is most useful in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Aspirin \nis considered first-line treatment (start 24 hours after TPA). \n• When there is a known allergy to aspirin or recurrent cerebrovascular events on aspirin \nalone, add dipyridamole or switch to clopidogrel to enhance antiplatelet therapy.\n• Do not combine aspirin and clopidogrel for a stroke.

Endarterectomy may benefit those who are  asymptomatic if \nthere is >60% stenosis in men age <60. The benefit of endarterectomy is less certain in women \nbecause they have a lower risk of stroke. The more severe the disease, the greater the benefit. \nCarotid stenting is an alternative to endarterectomy.\nEndarterectomy is simply not clear in asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The Step 2 exam does not \nengage in unanswerable, controversial issues.\nCarotid angioplasty and stenting are not as good as endarterectomy for symptomatic patients \nwith >70% stenosis. Angioplasty and stenting should be considered only for those who cannot \nundergo surgical endarterectomy.\nSEIZURES AND EPILEPSY\nA 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after \nbeing found convulsing in his bedroom.

    "page_429": "422\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nA seizure is a paroxysmal event due to abnormally discharging central nervous system (CNS) \nneurons. Epilepsy is a condition involving recurrent seizures, due to a chronic underlying pro -\ncess. The causes of seizure can be remembered from the acronym “VITAMINS”:\n• Vascular (stroke, bleed, arteriovenous malformation)\n• Infection (meningitis, abscess, encephalitis)\n• Trauma (especially penetrating)\n• Autoimmune (CNS vasculitis)\n• Metabolic (hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, \ndrug overdose/withdrawal)\n• Idiopathic\n• Neoplasm\n• pSychiatric\nClinical Presentation.  A seizure is essentially a paroxysmal, involuntary event (associated \nwith abnormal movement or change of consciousness or both). Characteristically, it is sudden \nin onset, with or without an aura. Patients often complain of disorientation, sleepiness, and \naching muscles for minutes to hours after the event. Patients may also experience inconti-\nnence, tongue biting, and headache as a result of the seizure. \nIt may be difficult to differentiate seizure from syncope , and it is important to obtain a complete \nhistory from anyone who witnessed the event. Generally, syncope will not present with signifi -\ncant postictal symptoms. Patients will recover consciousness within several minutes of the \nevent. Physical exam for syncope will show no evidence of incontinence or tongue biting.\nIt is important to classify seizures according to their clinical features because this will deter -\nmine what medications will be used for treatment. Seizures can be classified as partial versus \ngeneralized , and then  simple versus complex .\n• Partial  seizure occurs within discrete portions of the brain. Symptoms include \ninvoluntary jerking of a finger or hand. \n –If consciousness is maintained for the duration of the seizure, that is a simple  \npartial seizure. If there is a change in consciousness  for the duration of the seizure, \nthat is a  complex  partial seizure. \n –When a partial seizure progresses to a generalized seizure, that is a partial seizure \nwith secondary generalization . Typically, the seizure will begin focally and \nbecome generalized as seizure activity involves both cerebral hemispheres.\n• Generalized seizure  arises from both cerebral hemispheres spontaneously without \nany detectable focal onset. \n –Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal)  seizure is characterized by tonic contraction \nof muscles throughout the body followed by intermittent relaxation of various \nmuscle groups (clonic phase). \n –Absence  (petit mal)  seizure is more common in children than adults; it is character -\nized by sudden, brief loss of consciousness without loss of postural tone. Character -\nistically, EEG will show a generalized, symmetric 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge \npattern. Atonic seizure is characterized by sudden loss of postural tone lasting 1 to 2 \nseconds. Myoclonic  seizure is characterized by sudden, brief muscle contraction.\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   422 16/05/19   11:17 AM",
    "page_430": "Chapter 11   ●  Neurology\n423\nStatus epilepticus is defined as recurrent or continuous seizures (lasting at least 5–30 min).\nDiagnosis.  For idiopathic seizure, diagnosis is made only after secondary precipitating factors \nhave been ruled out. For epilepsy, diagnosis  is done with EEG. However, an abnormal EEG \nalone is not diagnostic, as 2-18% of the population has an abnormal EEG. Always check serum \nelectrolytes, glucose, toxicology, and arterial blood gas to rule out hypoxia as a cause of a \npatient’s seizure. CT scan or MRI of the head is usually indicated to rule out a structural lesion \nas the cause of seizure. Think of any seizure as a symptom, much like shortness of breath or \nchest pain, which has an extensive differential diagnosis. The evaluation of any seizing patient \nis to rule out reversible causes of seizure.\nTreatment of seizure can be divided into management of the acutely seizing patient  (status \nepilepticus) and the chronic epileptic patient .\nIn the acutely seizing patient :\n• Secure the airway, breathing, and circulation. \n• Once an adequate airway is established, breathing is assured, and the patient is \nhemodynamically stable, then simultaneously evaluate and treat any precipitating \ncause of seizure. \n• If a reversible cause is identified, treat aggressively.\n• If the patient continues to seize, the following strategy is appropriate. \n –The initial drug of choice is lorazepam or diazepam (both benzodiazepines). These \nmedications work by potentiating GABA receptor function. \n –If the patient continues to seize, add phenytoin or fosphenytoin, which inhibits \nsodium-dependent action potentials. CNS side effects of phenytoin include diplo -\npia, dizziness, and ataxia. Systemic side effects include gum hyperplasia, lymphade -\nnopathy, hirsutism, and rash. \n –If the patient continues to seize, add phenobarbital. Side effects include  sedation, \nataxia, and rash. \n –If, despite all of the above therapy, the patient continues to seize, add  midazolam or \npropofol.\nIn patients with first-time seizure , anticonvulsant therapy should be started only  if patient has:\n• Abnormal neurologic exam\n• Presented with status epilepticus\n• Strong family history of seizure\n• Abnormal EEG\nOtherwise, first-time seizure is generally not treated with long-term anticonvulsant therapy.\nThere is no superior drug in pregnancy. Valproic acid is clearly more dangerous in pregnancy.\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   423 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

She describes walking to her bathroom and experiencing a sudden \nfeeling of nausea. She then vomited and fell to the floor. She was unable to get up \nbut was able to call 911. The patient describes a feeling of the room “spinning” \naround her, even though she realizes she was not moving.\nVertigo is a false sensation of movement, i.e., the sensation of movement in the absence of actual \nmovement. It may be caused by Ménière disease, labyrinthitis, positional vertigo, traumatic vertigo, \nperilymphatic fistula, and cervical vertigo. Other causes include vascular disease of the brain stem, \narteriovenous malformation, brain tumor, MS, drug overdose, and vertebrobasilar migraine.\nClinical Presentation.  With the dizzy patient, the first step is to determine the nature of the \npatient’s complaints. “Dizziness” is a nonspecific term that provides no meaningful informa-\ntion about what is occurring to the patient. Simply by taking a complete history, it is possible \nto determine whether the patient is experiencing vertigo or presyncope.\nPatients who experience vertigo will describe a sensation of movement without actually \nmoving. They often describe their environment ‘spinning around them. ’ Sensations of tilting, \nswaying, or falling forward or backward are all consistent with vertigo. Acutely, these episodes \nare commonly associated with nausea and vomiting.\nPatients who complain of presyncope will describe their symptoms as “lightheadedness” or \n“feeling like I’m going to black out. ” Associated symptoms include generalized weakness, \npalpitations, and shortness of breath. It is essential to differentiate vertigo from presyncope \nbecause vertigo is usually a manifestation of neurologic disease, whereas presyncope is a \ncardinal manifestation of cardiovascular disease.\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   425 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

Each episode \nlasts 1 to 8 hours. The symptoms wax and wane as the endolymphatic pressure rises and falls. \nThe two most common causes of Ménière disease are syphilis and head trauma.\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo  is a cause of peripheral vertigo that characteristically is \nexacerbated by head movement or change in head position. Typically, episodes will occur in \nclusters that persist for several days. There will be a latency of several seconds after head \nmovement before the onset of vertigo. The vertigo usually lasts 10 to 60 seconds.\nLabyrinthitis  presents with sudden onset of severe vertigo that lasts for several days with hearing \nloss and tinnitus. The disease frequently follows an upper respiratory tract infection.\nPerilymphatic fistula  is a form of peripheral vertigo related temporally to head trauma (blunt \ntrauma to the ear, e.g., a slap to the ear) or extreme barotrauma during air flight, scuba diving, \nor vigorous Valsalva maneuver. Explosions deafen people.\nCentral vertigo is caused by any cerebellar or brain-stem tumor, bleed, or ischemia. Drug \ntoxicity or overdoses are important causes of central vertigo. Also, in the young patient with \nunexplained central vertigo, consider multiple sclerosis.\nTreatment.  Symptomatic treatment for peripheral vertigo includes meclizine or, in severe \ncases, diazepam.\nMénière disease  is treated with a low-salt diet and diuretics. In patients who fail medical \ntherapy, you can consider surgical decompression.\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo  is treated with positional maneuvers that attempt to move \nthe otolith out of the circular canals (e.g., Dix Hallpike and Barany maneuvers).\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   426 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

She locates her headache at the right side of her head and describes it \nas throbbing in quality. The headache is worsened by walking up stairs or around \nthe block. She experiences nausea but denies vomiting. She also states that loud \nnoise and bright light exacerbate her pain.\nHeadache is defined as pain located in the head, neck, or jaw. There are many causes.  Primary \nheadache syndromes  include migraine (affecting 15% of the general population), cluster, and \ntension headache. Secondary causes of headache include intracranial hemorrhage, brain \ntumor, meningitis, temporal arteritis, and glaucoma. \nClinical Presentation.  The single most important question to answer with a patient \n presenting with a complaint of headache is whether a serious underlying cause exists for the \nsymptoms. By taking a thorough history and performing an adequate physical examination, it \nis possible to make this differentiation. \n• Determine whether this is the patient’s first episode of headache: a history of recurrent \nsymptoms makes the diagnosis of a primary headache disorder more likely, while a \nfirst-time headache, especially severe and rapidly peaking, speaks strongly for serious \nunderlying pathology.\n• Headache with fever and nuchal rigidity suggests meningitis as the underlying cause. \nConversely, a headache described as “the worst headache of my life” and/or “thunder -\nclap” at onset, and is accompanied by nuchal rigidity without  fever, suggests an \nintracranial hemorrhage as the underlying cause. \n• Patients with brain tumor will present complaining of headache that is described as a \ndeep, dull, aching pain and disturbs sleep. A history of vomiting which precedes the \nonset of headache by a number of weeks, or a history of headache induced by cough -\ning, lifting, or bending, is typical of posterior fossa brain tumor. \n• Patients with temporal arteritis complain of a unilateral pounding headache associ -\nated with visual changes, described as dull and boring with superimposed lancinating \npain. Their symptoms also include polymyalgia rheumatica, jaw claudication, fever, \nweight loss, and scalp tenderness (difficulty combing hair or lying on a pillow). The \nscalp tenderness is from pain over the temporal artery. Temporal arteritis is a disorder \nof the elderly, e.g., age >50. Temporal arteritis gives an elevated sedimentation rate and \nis diagnosed with biopsy of the temporal artery. Do not wait for the biopsy results to \ninitiate therapy with steroids.\n• Patients with glaucoma will usually give a history of eye pain preceding the onset of \nthe headache.Note\nAny patient who presents with \nheadache and the following \nshould be considered to have \na secondary headache \nsyndrome:\n• “Worst headache of my life”\n•  Worsening symptoms over \ndays to weeks\n• Abnormal neurologic exam\n• Fever\n•  Vomiting preceding the \nheadache\n•  Headache induced by \ncoughing, bending, lifting, \nor onset age >55\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   427 16/05/19   11:17 AM",
    "page_435": "428\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nOnce serious underlying pathology is excluded by history and physical examination, primary \nheadache syndromes should be considered. The main primary headache syndromes are \nmigraine, cluster, and tension headache.\nMigraine headaches are defined as a benign and recurrent syndrome of headache, nausea/\nvomiting, and other varying neurologic dysfunctions. Patients will describe the headache as \npulsatile, throbbing, unilateral, and aggravated by minor movement. Other associated features \ninclude photophobia, phonophobia, and the time to maximal pain (4 to 72 hours). Migraine is \na likely diagnosis when a typical trigger can be identified. Typical triggers include alcohol, \ncertain foods (such as chocolate, various cheeses, monosodium glutamate), hunger, or irregu -\nlar sleep patterns.\n• Migraine without aura is a migraine without a preceding focal neurologic deficit.\n• Migraine with aura (classic migraine) is a migraine accompanied by a preceding aura \nthat consists of motor, sensory, or visual symptoms. Focal neurologic symptoms usually \noccur during the headache rather than as a prodrome. The pathognomonic aura for \nclassic migraine is the scintillating scotoma. Only 20% of migraine headaches are \naccompanied by an aura. Visual auras are also described as stars, sparks, and flashes of \nlight. Migraine equivalent is defined as focal neurologic symptoms without the classic \ncomplaints of headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n• Complicated migraine is migraine with severe neurologic deficits which persist after \nthe resolution of pain.\n• Basilar migraine is migraine associated with symptoms consistent with brain-stem \ninvolvement (vertigo, diplopia, ataxia, or dysarthria).\nTension-type headaches are described as tight, band-like headaches that occur bilaterally. \nPatients may also describe their headache as “vise-like, ” and these headaches may be associated \nwith tightness of the posterior neck muscles. Patients will describe their pain as one that builds \nslowly, and the pain may persist for several days with or without fluctuations. Movement will \nnot generally exacerbate the headache.\nCluster headaches, common in men, begin without warning and are typically described as \nexcruciating, unilateral, periorbital, and peaking in intensity within 5 minutes of onset. They are \nrarely described as pulsatile in nature. The attacks last from 30 minutes to 3 hours and occur \n1–3 × day for a 4-to-8-week period. Symptoms associated with cluster headaches include \nrhinorrhea, reddening of the eye, lacrimation, nasal stuffiness, nausea, and sensitivity to alcohol. \nHorner syndrome is sometimes found. Emotion and food rarely will trigger a cluster headache.\nDiagnosis.  Patients with severe, sudden onset of a first-time headache accompanied by strong \nevidence for an underlying cause on history or physical examination should have a CT scan of \nthe head to rule out any secondary causes.\nTreatment.  Always begin with an attempt to identify probable triggers for the patient and to \nmodify lifestyle by avoiding those triggers. Most patients will require pharmacotherapy as well.\nPharmacologic treatment for migraine headaches can be divided into management of an acute \nepisode and prophylaxis. Initially, for a mild migraine—which is defined as headache in the \nabsence of nausea or vomiting—NSAIDs may be used.\nAcutely, abortive therapy consists of sumatriptan, which acts as a serotonin receptor  agonist. \nDihydroergotamine is the alternative to the triptans. Ergotamine can be used in combination \nwith caffeine. The triptans are contraindicated in patients with known cardiovascular disease, \n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   428 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

These medications can be given orally, intranasally, or even \nsubcutaneously, depending on the severity of the headache. Alternatively, ergotamine can be \ngiven for acute abortive therapy. Dopamine antagonists such as metoclopramide can be given \nacutely as oral formulations to aid in the absorption of other abortive medications. When given \nparenterally, dopamine antagonists can provide relief acutely for migraine headaches.\nProphylactic treatment for migraine therapy should be initiated when patients have acute \nmigraine headaches >3–4/month. The best prophylactic medication is a beta blocker. Proprano -\nlol, valproic acid, and topiramate are all considered first-line therapy for migraine prophylaxis. \nVerapamil and tricyclics can also be used. These medications take 2 to 6 weeks to have an effect \nand can be discontinued gradually over 6 months once clinical stabilization has occurred. \nMethysergide is not used because of the serious side effects associated with prolonged use \n(valvular and retroperitoneal fibrosis). SSRIs such as sertraline and fluoxetine can also be used \nfor prophylaxis.\nTable 11-3.

They are used only in patients with severe, \ninfrequent migraines that are unresponsive to other therapy. Other therapies for migraine \nheadaches are acetaminophen and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.\nTreatment for tension headaches consists of relaxation. Patients should be encouraged to find \nactivities that are relaxing for them. Initial pharmacotherapy consists of acetaminophen and \nNSAIDs. If the headache remains refractory to these medications, a muscle relaxant can be \nadded to the regimen.\nCluster headaches are treated with a triptan or 100% oxygen.

    "page_438": "Chapter 11   ●  Neurology\n431\nGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, often severe polyradiculopathy, whose underlying \npathophysiology is an autoimmune destruction of myelin. Evidence suggests that GBS is \ncaused by a misdirection of the immune response, where the body’s immune system attacks \nself-antigens mistaken for foreign antigens (molecular mimicry).\nClinical Presentation.  Most patients present with rapidly developing weakness that typically \nbegins in the lower extremities and moves upward. On physical examination the patient is noted \nto lack reflexes in the muscle groups affected. The progression of the symptoms will develop over \nhours to days, with the legs typically more affected than the arms or face. Fever, constitutional \nsymptoms, or bladder dysfunction are rare and should raise the possibilities of alternate diagno -\nses.\nIn addition to the motor weakness, patients will typically complain of sensory disturbances \nthat can take the form of pain or tingling dysesthesia. Sensory changes are due to loss of large \nsensory fibers, producing loss of reflexes and proprioception. Autonomic instability (profuse \nsweating, postural hypotension, labile blood pressure, cardiac dysrhythmias) occurs in severe \nGBS, requiring patient treatment in an intensive care unit.\nApproximately 75% of patients who present with GBS will have a history of an infection  \n1–3 weeks preceding the onset of symptoms. The infection is typically in the respiratory or GI \nsystems ( Campylobacter jejuni ), it might be an infection with human herpesvirus, cytomegalo-\nvirus, or Epstein-Barr. GBS occurs more frequently in patients with HIV , systemic lupus \nerythematosus, and lymphoma.\nDiagnosis.  Diagnosis lies principally in recognizing the typical pattern of weakness with the \nabsence of reflexes, fever, and constitutional symptoms. Lumbar puncture for protein and cell \ncount is the best initial test. The characteristic finding is elevated protein without an associated \nrise in cell count on CSF (only seen 48 hours after the onset of symptoms). The most accurate \ntest for diagnosis is electromyography (EMG). EMG is used to detect evidence of demyelin-\nation of the peripheral nerves.\nTreatment.  IV immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis are equally effective treatments. There is \nno benefit to combination therapy. Initiate treatment as quickly as possible, as therapy \nbecomes ineffective about 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.\nAlso, it is extremely important to monitor vital capacity in patients with GBS and initiate early \nrespiratory support to prevent death from respiratory failure.\nGlucocorticoids are not effective for acute GBS. \nMYASTHENIA GRAVIS\nA 35-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of double vision that seems \nto worsen near the end of the day. She also complains of difficulty chewing meat \nand other hard foods. She notices that her symptoms improve following a good \nnight’s sleep. On neurologic examination you note a snarling appearance when the \npatient is asked to smile, and a nasal tone is heard in her voice. You also note a \nweakness in the upper extremities when the patient is asked to clench her fist \naround your finger repeatedly.Note\nThe only association between \nimmunizations and GBS \noccurred in 1976, with the \nintroduction of the swine \ninfluenza vaccine.

The major features in a patient’s history which help to diagnose MG are \nmuscle weakness and fatigability. Initially, patients will complain of diplopia, ptosis, and \ndifficulty swallowing. Speech may have a “mushy” or nasal quality and facial weakness may \nmanifest as a “snarling” appearance when smiling. As the disease progresses, weakness may \nbecome generalized, involving proximal muscles in an asymmetric pattern. Deep tendon \nreflexes are intact. Pupillary responses are normal. There are no sensory abnormalities. Very \nsevere disease may affect the muscles of respiration.\nEaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome is characterized by increasing  muscle strength on \nrepetitive contraction. This syndrome is seen in association with malignancy, especially \nsmall-cell carcinoma of the lung.\nBotulism may cause a myasthenic-like illness, but the pupils are usually dilated and repetitive \nnerve stimulation (on EMG) shows an incremental increase in muscular fiber contraction \n(opposite of myasthenia gravis).\nDiagnosis.  The best initial test for the diagnosis of MG is the acetylcholine-receptor antibody \ntest. In generalized MG, 80–90% of patients will have a positive test. In the presence of \nfatigable muscle weakness, a positive antibody test is specific and virtually diagnostic. Anti-\nbodies are present in only 70% of those with disease limited to the eyes.\nThe edrophonium (Tensilon) test is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis. Additionally, \npatients may experience nausea, diarrhea, fasciculations, syncope (rare), or bradycardia during \nthe test, which are cholinergic symptoms.\nImaging studies of the chest such as x-rays and CT scan should be performed to detect a \nthymoma. Thymoma is found in 10–15% of patients. Thymic hyperplasia is found in 65%.\nThe most accurate test for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is electromyography (EMG). The \ncharacteristic finding is a decremental decrease in muscle fiber contraction on repetitive nerve \nstimulation.\nTreatment.  Anticholinesterase (usually pyridostigmine or neostigmine) medications are \nuseful for the symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis. Pyridostigmine is longer lasting. If \ntreatment with anticholinesterase medications is unsuccessful in providing symptomatic relief, \nthe physician should consider immunosuppressive therapy.\nThere are numerous medications used for immunosuppressive therapy. These interventions \nprimarily differ in the onset of therapeutic benefit. They are used if thymectomy is not effective.\nGlucocorticoids are effective in improving weakness but take 1 to 3 months for you to observe \na clinical benefit. Steroids are the initial immunosuppressive of choice. If patients fail steroid \ntherapy, azathioprine is the most widely used medication used in combination with steroids. \nThe benefits of azathioprine therapy may take >3–6 months to peak. Cyclosporine and \ncyclophosphamide are alternatives to azathioprine but are more toxic.\nPlasmapheresis and IV immunoglobulin are immunosuppressive therapies noted for their \nability to rapidly improve weakness in myasthenia gravis. They are therefore reserved for \npatients in acute myasthenic crisis. These therapies are used when respiratory involvement \noccurs or when patients go to the operating room.\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   432 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

Thymectomy is performed \nin those not controlled with anticholinesterase medications to prevent the use of potentially \ntoxic medication such as systemic steroids. Thymectomies are also performed when a thy-\nmoma is present to prevent the spread of malignant thymic disease.\nAminoglycoside antibiotics may exacerbate myasthenia gravis and should be avoided. In fact, \nmany medications may worse myasthenia gravis.\nMycophenolate is a newer immunosuppressive drug with less adverse effects than steroids or \ncyclophosphamide.\nAMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS\nAmyotrophic  lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an idiopathic disorder of both upper and lower motor \nneurons. ALS has a unique presentation of muscle weakness combined with signs of upper \nmotor neuron loss, cranial nerve palsies, respiratory involvement, and lower motor neuron \ndestruction, while at the same time preserving bowel, bladder sensory, cognitive, and sexual \nfunction. \n• The cranial nerve, or bulbar, palsies result in dysphagia, difficulty chewing, decreased \ngag reflex, dysarthria (difficulty in articulating words), and difficulty in handling \nsaliva. \n• Since there is often respiratory muscle involvement, recurrent aspiration  pneumonia is \nthe most common cause of death. \n• A weak cough is also characteristic, and this only worsens the respiratory problem.\n• There is no pain from abnormal sensory neuropathy because this is entirely a motor \nneuron disease. On the other hand, the upper motor neuron involvement gives \nsignificant spasticity that can lead to pain. \n• Mentation, bowel, bladder, and sexual function remain intact for the same reason. In \nother words, a fully mentally alert patient loses nearly all motor control while still \nbeing able to think and perceive. The patient becomes fully aware of being trapped in \na body that does not function. \n• Head ptosis occurs because the extensor muscles of the neck become too weak to keep \nthe head up.\nUpper motor neuron manifestations are weakness with spasticity and hyperreflexia. Lower \nmotor neuron manifestations are weakness with muscle wasting, atrophy, and fasciculations; \nthis includes tongue atrophy. The combination of upper and lower motor neuron weakness is \nthe unique presentation of ALS. The most accurate confirmatory test is the electromyogram, \nwhich will show diffuse axonal disease. CPK levels are sometimes mildly elevated, and the \ncerebrospinal fluid and MRI scans are normal.\nThe only treatment that may slow down the progression of the disease is riluzole, which is \nthought to work by inhibiting glutamate release. Death typically results in 3–5 years. Spasticity \nis treated with baclofen and tizanidine.\nMany of the USMLE exam questions regarding ALS will be ethical questions on issues of the \nwithholding of care . Since ALS has no impact on cognitive function, the patient is felt to \nretain the capacity to make medical decisions. \n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   433 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

Her symptoms began several days ago and \nhave worsened over the last several hours. She states that 3 years ago she had an \nepisode of “seeing double” that lasted 2 days and resolved on its own.

Increased spasticity is also noted in her lower extremities.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the CNS white matter \ncharacterized by a relapsing or progressive course. The cause is thought to be multifactorial; \nthere is evidence that genetic susceptibility plays an important role. The disease occurs \nprimarily in female populations of Northern European descent and of child-bearing age, \nrespectively. This implies a role for some sort of environmental trigger (infectious, dietary, \nclimatic). Pathologically, focal areas of demyelination are characteristic of the disease.\nClinical Presentation.  Commonly, patients will present complaining of weakness, numbness, \ntingling, or unsteadiness of a limb. Urinary urgency or retention, blurry vision, and double \nvision are all common initial manifestations of the disease. Symptoms may persist for several \nweeks or may resolve spontaneously over a few days.\nThere are several forms of the disease that may change the course of management and are \ntherefore important to recognize. Most patients will have a months-long to years-long disease-\nfree period after their first exacerbation.\n• Relapsing remitting disease:  progression is characterized by relapses of active disease \nwith incomplete recovery during the periods of remission\n• Secondary progressive disease:  progression becomes more aggressive so that a \nconsistent worsening of function occurs\n• Primary progressive disease:  symptoms are progressive from the onset of disease \nwith the early onset of disability (least common form)\nIt is important to understand when the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be suspected. \nClassically, the diagnosis is made clinically when a young patient (usually age <55) presents \nwith a history of multiple neurologic complaints that cannot be explained by the presence of \none CNS lesion. In other words, suspect the diagnosis when a patient presents with multiple \nneurologic deficits separated by time and space (anatomy) .\nA number of triggers are known to exacerbate the disease. Infections or trauma may acutely \nworsen the disease. Pregnancy, especially the 2 to 3 months following birth, may also exacer -\nbate symptoms. However, there are generally fewer attacks during the pregnancy.

    "page_442": "Chapter 11   ●  Neurology\n435\nDiagnosis.  To diagnose MS you have to rely on clinical criteria supplemented with radiologic \nand laboratory confirmations. The advent of MRI scanning of the brain has dramatically \nchanged the methods by which multiple sclerosis is diagnosed.\nMRI of the brain is the most accurate test to diagnose MS, reaching a sensitivity of 85 to 95% \nin symptomatic persons. Increased T2 and decreased T1 intensity represent the increased \nwater content of demyelinated plaques in the cerebrum and spine. Enhancement of lesions \nwith gadolinium indicates active MS lesions that may enhance for up to 2 to 6 weeks after an \nexacerbation. MS is an unusual disease in that the best initial test for the diagnosis is also the \nmost sensitive one, namely MRI of the brain and spine.\nEvoked response potentials detect slow or abnormal conduction in response to visual, audi-\ntory, or somatosensory stimuli. The limitation of this test for the diagnosis of MS is that many \nother neurologic diseases can give an abnormal result. The test is not specific for the diagnosis \nof MS. As a result, evoked potentials are rarely used to make the diagnosis.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis usually reveals a mild pleocytosis (usually <50 cells/μL) and \na total protein that is mildly elevated. A protein level exceeding 100 mg/dL is unusual and \nshould be considered as evidence against the diagnosis of MS. An elevated IgG index (oligoclo -\nnal bands) is found in 70 to 90% of patients with MS. The finding is nonspecific, and as a \nresult, CSF for oligoclonal banding is recommended only when the MRI is nonconfirmatory \nbut clinical suspicion for MS remains high.\nTreatment.  The treatment of multiple sclerosis can be divided into disease-modifying therapy, \ntreatment of complications, and treatment for symptomatic relief during an acute exacerba-\ntion. The specific agents used depend on progression of the disease at the time of diagnosis.\nIn relapsing-remitting disease, there are 3 disease-modifying agents that have been shown to \nreduce the number of clinical exacerbations and the number of MRI lesions:\n• Interferon-β1a\n• Interferon-β1b\n• Glatiramer acetate\nMore importantly, these medications seem to delay the onset of significant disability. \n Glatiramer is also known as copolymer I.\nIn secondary progressive disease, interferon-β1b and mitoxantrone have been shown to reduce \nthe number of exacerbations, decrease MRI activity, and delay onset of disability. In patients \nwho receive mitoxantrone, dose-related cardiotoxicity is a concern; mitoxantrone should be \ngiven only to patients with a normal ejection fraction. Mitoxantrone is not a first-line agent to \nprevent disease progression because of its cardiotoxicity. In patients with relapsing-remitting \ndisease or secondary progressive disease who cannot tolerate treatment with IFN-β1b, \nIFN-β1a, or glatiramer acetate, you can consider treatment with methotrexate, mitoxantrone, \ncyclophosphamide, IV immunoglobulin, or azathioprine. ACTH is no longer used.\nNo approved disease-modifying therapy exists at this time for primary progressive disease.\nMitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, and natalizumab are not used for a first episode of disease. \nNatalizumab is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).\nThe length and intensity of an acute exacerbation are shortened by the administration of \nglucocorticoids. Typically, an acute exacerbation is treated with 3 days of intense IV steroids \nfollowed by a course of oral medication tapered over 4 weeks. In patients with severe disease who \nare unresponsive to steroid therapy, plasma exchange can be used as an alternative treatment.\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   435 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

    "page_444": "Chapter 11   ●  Neurology\n437\nThere are more than 100 identifiable causes of dementia in the elderly. \n• Reversible causes  include hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, hepatic or uremic \nencephalopathy, CNS vasculitis, syphilis, brain abscess, brain tumor (primary or \nmetastatic), medications (especially anticholinergics), obstructive sleep apnea, central \nsleep apnea, trauma, subdural hematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and \ndepression. \n• Irreversible causes  include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Alzheimer \ndisease (60–80% of all cases) , dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal degenera -\ntion including Pick disease, vascular dementia including multi-infarct dementia and \nBinswanger disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). \nClinical Presentation.  The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer disease. Typically, \npatients will present with problems in memory and visuospatial abilities that generally occur \nearly in the course of the disease. Social graces can be retained despite significant loss of cognitive \ndecline. Hallucinations and personality changes typically occur late in the course of the disease.\nMild cognitive impairment refers to memory loss without dysfunction of other cognitive \ndomains. These patients have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer disease later in life but do \nnot have Alzheimer disease. The rate of progression is 15–20% per year.\nAlzheimer disease is, by definition, the loss of memory as well as other cognitive  disturbances, \nsuch as aphasia, agnosia (the failure to identify entities despite intact sensory function), \napraxia, or the loss of the ability to make plans and execute them. There is no single diagnostic \ntest for Alzheimer disease.\nPatients with frontotemporal dementias such as Pick disease will typically present with \npersonality changes early in the course of their disease, with relative sparing of their visuospa-\ntial function. Social, interpersonal, and emotional abnormalities precede memory impairment. \nFrontotemporal dementia is often noted primarily by the family because the patient lacks \ninsight into their condition. There is no proven therapy for this condition.\nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) can be confused with delirium and is characterized by \nfluctuating cognitive impairment.\nDementia secondary to Parkinson disease should be accompanied by clinical findings consis-\ntent with that disease. Recurrent visual hallucinations are also characteristic.\nDementia secondary to CJD is characterized by a shorter (weeks to months), more aggressive \ncourse than Alzheimer disease. Patients with CJD will present with dementia and myoclonus. \nVariant CJD is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). BSE is from the ingestion of prions \nfrom affected cattle. The diagnosis of CJD is by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, \nataxia, and the presence of 14-3-3 protein in the CSF. EEG may also help diagnose. These \ncriteria can eliminate the need for brain biopsy.\nVascular dementia is divided into multi-infarct dementia, which typically has a stepwise \nprogression associated with discrete cerebrovascular events, and Binswanger disease, involving \nthe subcortical white matter, which presents with a slowly progressive course.\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus will present with prominent gait abnormalities early in the \ncourse of the disease that usually precede the onset of cognitive impairment. There will also be \nassociated urinary incontinence.\nDiagnosis.  All patients with cognitive impairment should be assessed with a Mini Mental \nStatus Examination (MMSE) to identify the areas of cognitive impairment.Note\nThe prevalence of dementia is \n1–5% at ages 65–69, and \nrising to 45% by age 100.

If a reversible \ncause is identified, it should be treated, with the hope that cognitive function can be recovered. \nLaboratory studies should include a complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, \nliver function studies, glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin B12, RPR, and HIV .\nBrain imaging is most useful for patients who have a focal neurologic exam, seizures, gait \nabnormalities, and an acute or subacute onset of their symptoms. EEG and CSF evaluation are \nnot necessary except for NPH-opening pressure. No CSF marker is proven beneficial with the \nexception of 14-3-3 protein in CJD.\nTreatment.  Treatment of dementia revolves around ensuring that the family and the patient \nhave the proper medical and emotional support to cope with the disease. Caregivers are at an \nincreased risk for depression and anxiety. Their concerns and frustrations should be addressed \nat frequent intervals.\nRaising the level of acetylcholine in CSF benefits patients with Alzheimer disease. Pharmaco-\ntherapy with donepezil has been shown to improve cognitive function in mild to moderate \ndementia. Other anticholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, galantamine) appear to have \nsimilar efficacy.\nMemantine is a disease-modifying drug used in advanced disease either alone or with a \ncholinesterase inhibitor.

The gene contains a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that \ncodes for a protein called huntingtin . The HD mutation leads to abnormal cleavage of the \nhuntingtin protein, interfering with nuclear mechanisms, and causing cell death. \nThe disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Successive generations tend to have \nthe disease occurring at an earlier age. This is called anticipation .\nClinical hallmarks of the disease include chorea and behavioral disturbance. Onset is  usually \nin decade 4 or 5 of life, and can begin with either chorea or behavioral change. \n• The personality changes consist of irritability, anger, paranoia, or signs of depression. \nAntisocial behavior may develop. \n• The chorea changes may begin as fidgeting that progresses to sudden movements of \nthe trunk or limbs. Gait is poorly coordinated and has a choreic quality. Memory is \nusually preserved until late in the disease but lack of judgment, disinhibition, and \ninattention are early manifestations. There is frequently an associated depression. \nDementia becomes severe later in the disease.\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   438 16/05/19   11:17 AM",

    "page_447": "440\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nSeveral other diseases can imitate Parkinsonism. Severe depression can cause a paucity of sponta -\nneous movement that can mimic Parkinsonism. Essential tremor can be mistaken for the tremor \nof Parkinson disease, but the lack of other neurologic symptoms and a positive family history of \ntremor and its amelioration with alcohol distinguish the two entities. A normal pressure hydro -\ncephalus can present with ataxia and gait disturbances, which can also be mistaken for Parkinson \ndisease. The presence of dementia and urinary incontinence with dilated ventricles on a CT scan \nof the head can help identify this disorder. Huntington disease can present with akinesia and \nchorea. The positive family history and dementia usually suggest the correct diagnosis.\nDiagnosis.  The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is a clinical one. It is important to identify any \nsecondary causes of a patient’s Parkinsonism that are potentially reversible. There is no \ndiagnostic test of choice that can identify patients with Parkinson disease.\nTreatment.  There are many medications available for the treatment of Parkinson disease. The \nunderlying pathophysiology that causes Parkinson disease is the imbalance of dopaminergic (too \nlittle) and cholinergic (too much) tone on the basal ganglia. Thus, medical treatment revolves \naround increasing dopaminergic tone or decreasing cholinergic tone on the basal ganglia.\nNot surprisingly, the medications available for the medical treatment of Parkinson disease \ndirectly stimulate dopamine receptors (carbidopa/levodopa, dopamine agonists), indirectly \nincrease the amount of dopamine available (COMT inhibitors, selegiline, amantadine), or \nblock acetylcholine stimulation of the basal ganglia (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl).\nDirect-acting dopamine agonists such as pramipexole or ropinirole can be used alone as initial \ntherapy or in combination with small doses of levodopa/carbidopa. Two other dopamine \nagonists are bromocriptine and cabergoline. All of them are less efficacious than levodopa. \nDopamine agonists do, however, have less dyskinetic side effects. Bromocriptine and pergolide \nare ergot derivatives and can cause cardiac toxicity.\nThe first step when considering what medication to start with is evaluating the patient’s \nfunctional status. Patients with an intact functional status are managed differently from \npatients with a compromised functional status.\nPatients with intact functional status (less bradykinesia) are not generally given carbidopa/levodopa \nas initial therapy. Such patients are started on anticholinergic medication when they are age <60. \nThis is particularly true for those in whom tremor is the predominant symptom. When age >60, the \ntreatment of choice is amantadine. The reason why anticholinergics are relatively contraindicated in \nelderly patients is because the side effects (dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, confusion/\nhallucinations) occur more frequently and severely. Anticholinergics such as benztropine and \ntrihexyphenidyl are used mostly to relieve tremor and rigidity. Avoid with BPH and glaucoma.\nFor patients with compromised functional status (more significant bradykinesia), the best \ninitial therapy is carbidopa/levodopa. Carbidopa inhibits extracerebral dopa-decarboxylase, \nallowing more of the levodopa to reach the central nervous system, where it is needed. \nLevodopa is the precursor to dopamine. Carbidopa protects the levodopa from breakdown in \nthe periphery, ensuring its secure delivery to the central nervous system. There are several late \n complications to carbidopa/levodopa therapy: Dyskinesia (abnormal movements), akathisia \n(restlessness), and “on-off ” phenomena are all disconcerting to the patient. All of these late \nside effects are termed “response fluctuations” and can be managed by using a sustained release \nform of carbidopa/levodopa, adding a dopamine agonist, selegiline, or a COMT inhibitor, or \nrestricting the main protein meal to the night. COMT inhibitors are tolcapone and entaca-\npone. They are always used in conjunction with levodopa to help reduce the dose or modify \nresponse fluctuations. COMT inhibitors have no effect alone; they decrease the metabolism of \nthe levodopa. They are an adjunct to the use of levodopa to reduce adverse effects.\n11_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch11.indd   440 16/05/19   11:17 AM",
    "page_448": "Chapter 11   ●  Neurology\n441\nSelegiline was once thought to slow the progression of the disease. Selegiline can be used in \nthose with a declining or fluctuating response to levodopa. Selegiline offers mild symptomatic \nbenefit in early disease. Rasagiline is a newer version.\nSurgery should only be considered for patients who cannot tolerate or respond adequately to \nmedical therapy. The procedures usually performed are pallidotomy or thalamotomy. The \nplacement of deep brain stimulators is also effective when placed in the globus pallidus or \nsubthalamic nuclei. Surgical therapy is a last resort.\nBENIGN ESSENTIAL TREMOR\nThis is an idiopathic disorder consisting of an isolated tremor of the hands, head, or both. The \nlower extremities tend to be spared. Essential tremor can be worsened by the use of caffeine or \nbeta agonists. Examination reveals no other abnormalities. Although the level of disability \ntends to be limited, there can be interference with manual skills such as the ability to write.

Often the \ncondition is brought to attention because of multiple bruises sustained by the sleep partner. \nThe condition can be familial and is exacerbated by sleep deprivation, caffeine, and pregnancy. \nThere is also an association with uremia, iron deficiency, and peripheral neuropathy.\nThere is no specific diagnostic test for this disorder. Treatment is a dopamine agonist such as \npramipexole or ropinirole, although some patients may need levodopa/carbidopa. Other thera -\npies are narcotics and benzodiazepines.\nClinical Recall\nWhich of the following is a characteristic feature of Creutzfeldt-Jakob \ndisease?\nA.

Antibodies are produced against antigens in the \nintercellular spaces of the epidermal cells. They attack the “glue” that holds the epidermal \ncells together . “Pemphix” is from the Greek word for bubble, which is what a bulla looks like \nbefore it is broken. Pemphigus vulgaris is most often idiopathic, but ACE inhibitors or \npenicillamine can occasionally cause it.\nVulgaris occurs in patients age 30s and 40s. It occurs prominently in the mouth and starts \nthere. The oral lesions are erosions, not bullae. The bullae are very thin and flaccid and break \neasily. This leads to the loss of large volumes of skin surface area, so it acts like a burn. This is \nbecause the bullae occur from destruction within  the epidermis, making them thinner and \nmore fragile. The presence of the Nikolsky sign  (the easy removal of skin by just a little \npressure from the examiner’s finger, pulling the skin off like a sheet) is seen in pemphigus \nvulgaris, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\nThe lesions of pemphigus vulgaris are painful , not pruritic.\nThe most accurate diagnostic test is to biopsy  the skin and to use immunofluorescent stains. \nThese stains will detect intercellular deposits of IgG and C3  in the epidermis.\nTreatment is with systemic glucocorticoids, such as prednisone. Topical steroids will not  \nbe sufficiently strong. Before the invention of steroids, pemphigus vulgaris was often fatal, with \npatients dying of sepsis and dehydration—just like a burn patient. For those in whom \nsteroids are ineffective or not tolerated, you can use azathioprine, mycophenolate, or \ncyclophosphamide. Rituximab and IVIG  are also effective.\nBullous Pemphigoid\nPemphigoid is 2× as common as pemphigus vulgaris and occurs in elderly persons age 70s \nand 80s. It can also be drug induced with sulfa drugs, including furosemide, penicillamine, \nand others.\nThe defect occurs at the dermo-epidermal junction , so the layer of skin that separates off is \nmuch thicker. Because the fracture of the skin causing the blisters is deeper, the bullae are \nthicker walled and much less likely to rupture. Oral lesions are rare. Because the bullae are \ntense and intact, the skin is better protected. There is no dressing for skin as good as skin \nitself. Hence, there is much less fluid loss, and infection is much less likely as compared with \npemphigus vulgaris. Mortality is much less likely in bullous pemphigoid.\nThe most accurate diagnostic test is a biopsy with immunofluorescent antibodies at the \ndermo-epidermal junction (basement membrane).\nSystemic steroids, such as prednisone, are the standard means of treatment. Tetracycline or \nerythromycin combined with nicotinamide is the alternative to steroids. Use topical  steroids \nonly if no oral lesions  are present.Note\nPemphigus vulgaris is a much \nmore serious and potentially \nlife-threatening disease than \npemphigoid.\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   444 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

Deficiency of \nthe enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase results in an abnormally high accumulation of \nporphyrins , which then leads to a photosensitivity reaction. The test question should give a \nhistory of HIV , alcoholism, liver disease, chronic hepatitis C, or a woman taking oral contra-\nceptives. The liver disease may be from any cause but is most likely to involve chronic infec-\ntious hepatitis or hemochromatosis because porphyria cutanea tarda is associated with \nincreased liver iron stores. Diabetes is found in 25% of patients.\nClinical Presentation.  Fragile, nonhealing blisters  are seen on the sun-exposed  parts of the \nbody, such as the backs of the hands and the face. This leads to hyperpigmentation of the skin \nin general and hypertrichosis of the face.\nDiagnosis.  The diagnostic test is a level of urinary uroporphyrins . Uroporphyrins are \nelevated 2–5× above the coproporphyrins in this disease.\nTreatment.  The best initial step in management is to stop drinking  alcohol (although it is \nunlikely to be effective) and to discontinue all estrogen use . Combine treatment with barrier \nsun protection, such as clothing, because most sunscreens do not seem to block the wave-\nlength of light causing the dermal reaction. The most effective therapy to use if this is insuffi-\ncient is phlebotomy to remove iron. Deferoxamine is used to remove iron if phlebotomy is not \npossible. Also, the antimalarial drug chloroquine increases the excretion of porphyrins.\nDRUG ERUPTIONS/HYPERSENSITIVITY\nUrticaria\nAcute urticaria is a hypersensitivity reaction most often mediated by IgE and mast cell \nactivation , resulting in evanescent wheals and hives . It is a type of localized, cutaneous \nanaphylaxis, but without the hypotension and hemodynamic instability. The most common \ncauses of acute urticaria are allergic reactions to medications, insect bites, and foods, and \noccasionally, the result of emotions. The most common medications are aspirin, NSAIDs, \nmorphine, codeine, penicillins, phenytoin, and quinolones. ACE inhibitors are also associated \nwith urticaria, as well as angioedema. The most common foods are peanuts, shellfish, toma-\ntoes, and strawberries. Contact with latex in any form can also cause urticaria.\nClinical Presentation.  Acute urticaria lasts <6 weeks in duration and two-thirds of cases are \nself-limited. Chronic urticaria lasts >6 weeks in duration and is associated with pressure on the \nskin, cold, or vibration. Pressure on the skin resulting in localized urticaria is also known as \ndermatographism . In acute cases, the onset of the wheals and hives is usually within 30 \nminutes and lasts for <24 hours. Itching is prominent. In patients with chronic urticaria lasting \n>6 weeks, you should investigate the etiology.\nTreatment.  Urticaria is treated with H1 antihistamines. Severe, acute urticaria is treated with \nolder medications, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl™), hydroxyzine (Atarax™), or cypro-\nheptadine. If it is life-threatening, use H2 antihistamines when H1 antihistamines fail and add \nsystemic steroids. Chronic therapy is with newer, nonsedating antihistamines, such loratadine, \ndesloratadine, fexofenadine, or cetirizine. Astemizole and terfenadine should never be used \nand are no longer marketed; they cause potentially fatal rhythm disturbances particularly \nwhen combined with other medications, such as macrolide antibiotics, because of their effect \non the hepatic P450 system.\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   445 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

Urticaria\nMorbilliform Rashes\nA morbilliform rash is a milder version of a hypersensitivity reaction compared with urticaria. \nThis is the “typical” type of drug reaction and is lymphocyte mediated .\nThe rash resembles measles and is usually secondary to medications that the patient is allergic \nto, such as penicillin, sulfa drugs, allopurinol, or phenytoin. It is a generalized, maculopapular \neruption that blanches  with pressure. The reaction can appear a few days after the exposure \nand may begin even after the medication has been stopped.\nAntihistamines are effective, and steroids are rarely necessary.\nErythema Multiforme\nAlthough erythema multiforme (EM) may be caused by the same types of medications that \ncause urticaria and morbilliform rashes (penicillins, phenytoin, NSAIDs, and sulfa drugs), the \nmost common cause  of EM is a reaction to infection . The majority of cases follow infection \nwith herpes simplex or Mycoplasma .\nThe most characteristic feature of EM is target-like lesions  that occur especially on the palms \nand soles . These lesions can also be described as “iris-like. ” Bullae are not uniformly found. \nEM of this type usually does not involve mucous membranes.\nTreatment is antihistamines and treatment of the underlying infection.Note\nFor urticaria:\nAnswer “ terfenadine ” or \n“astemizole” only when the \ntest question asks what will kill \nthe patient or which is the \nmost dangerous medication.\nAnswer “ desensitization ” \nwhen the trigger cannot be \navoided, e.g., a beesting in a \nfarmer.

Erythema Multiforme\nStevens-Johnson Syndrome\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is sometimes called erythema multiforme major . It can be \ndifficult to distinguish from toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and, in fact, the two diseases \nmay be considered a spectrum of severity of the same disorder. All of these disorders may arise \nas a hypersensitivity response to the same set of medications, such as penicillins, sulfa drugs, \nNSAIDs, phenytoin, and phenobarbital.\nClinical Presentation.  SJS usually involves <10 to 15% of the total body surface area, and the \noverall mortality rate is <5 to 10%. There is mucous-membrane involvement in 90% of cases, \nmost often of the oral cavity and the conjunctivae, although there may be extensive involve-\nment of the respiratory tract.\nTreat patients with early admission to a burn unit, withdrawal of the offending drug, and \nsupportive care. Respiratory-tract involvement may be so severe as to require mechanical \nventilation. Death occurs from a combination of infection, dehydration, and malnutrition.\nThere is no proven benefit for steroids. The best initial therapy for severe disease is IV immuno -\nglobulins. Other therapies of unclear value are cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and thalidomide.\nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis\nToxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is the most serious version of a cutaneous hypersensitivity \nreaction. Mortality may be 40−50%.\nMuch more of the body surface area (BSA) is involved and may range from 30−100%. The \nNikolsky sign is present, and the skin easily sloughs off. TEN has certain features similar to \nstaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome; however, TEN is  drug induced  as opposed to being \ncaused by a toxin coming from an organism.\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   447 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

Systemic steroids are not effective and may, in fact, decrease survival.\nFixed Drug Reaction\nFixed drug reaction is a localized  allergic drug reaction that recurs at precisely the same \nanatomic site  on the skin with repeated drug exposure. It is not known why the reactions are \nanatomically localized and do not become generalized morbilliform rashes.

    "page_456": "Chapter 12   ●  Dermatology\n449\nINFECTIONS\nFungal Infections\nTinea pedis, cruris, corporis, versicolor, capitis, and onychomycosis\nAll of the superficial fungal infections of the body share a number of common characteristics \nleading to the same answer on the test for similar questions for each of these diseases. “Superfi-\ncial fungal infections” refer to those infections limited to the skin, nails, and hair. Remember, \nthough, that these answers would not be valid for more deep-seated, life-  threatening infec-\ntions, such as fungal endocarditis, meningitis, or abscesses.\nClinical Presentation and Diagnosis.  All superficial fungal infections of the skin, hair, and \nnails are primarily diagnosed by their visual appearance  and confirmed by a potassium hydrox -\nide (KOH) test  of the skin. The leading edge of the lesion on the skin or nails is scraped with a \nscalpel to remove some of the epithelial cells or some of the nail and hair. KOH has the ability \nto dissolve the epithelial cells and collagen of the nail, but does not have the ability to melt \naway the fungus. Hence, a KOH preparation gives an immediate diagnostic answer by reveal-\ning fungal hyphae. This is particularly characteristic in tinea versicolor, where the Malassezia \nfurfur  (Pityrosporum orbiculare)  organism appears in a “spaghetti and meatballs” pattern.\nThe most accurate test is to culture the fungus. This is usually not clinically practical because \nmolds that grow on the skin (dermatophytes) take up to 6 weeks to grow even on specialized \nfungal media. A specific species usually does not need to be isolated in most cases, unless it is \nan infection of the hair or nails. In the case of nail and hair infections, oral therapy is neces-\nsary, and it is important to be precise because there are fewer medications that can be used to \neffectively treat onychomycosis. Tinea tonsurans is the cause of >90% of cases of tinea capitis.\nTreatment.  For onychomycosis (nail infection) or hair infection (tinea capitis), the medica-\ntions with the greatest efficacy are oral terbinafine or itraconazole. These medications are used \nfor at least 6 weeks for fingernails and 12 weeks for toenails. Terbinafine is potentially hepato-\ntoxic, and it is important to periodically check liver function tests. Griseofulvin must be used \nfor 6 to 12 months in the treatment of fingernails and has much less antifungal efficacy than \nterbinafine. Griseofulvin is no longer recommended in the treatment of onychomycosis of the \ntoenails. In the treatment of tinea capitis, griseofulvin is recommended for 6 to 8 weeks.\nThe other fungal infections of the skin that don’t involve hair or nails may be treated with any of \nthe following topical medications : ketoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, terbinafine, micon -\nazole, sertaconazole, sulconazole, tolnaftate, or naftifine. There is no clear difference in efficacy \nor adverse effects between them when used topically. Ketoconazole has more adverse effects \nwhen used systemically, such as hepatotoxicity and gynecomastia. This is why ketoconazole is \nnot a good choice for onychomycosis. There is no topical form of fluconazole. Fluconazole is \nalso less efficacious for dermatophytes of the nails when used systemically.\nAntifungal medications generally should not be used in combination with topical steroids, \nunless a diagnosis has been confirmed. Steroids in a cream can relieve redness and itching and \ngive the appearance of improvement even in impetigo and contact dermatitis.\nTinea versicolor\nTinea versicolor is a skin infection characterized by multiple macules (usually asymptomatic), \nvarying in color from white to brown. It is caused by  Pityrosporum orbiculare   (Malassezia furfur ).Note\nDrug of choice for oral \nantifungal treatment:\n•  Tinea capitis and \nonychomycosis \n –Terbinafine or \nitraconazole\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   449 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

Consider \nlocal or systemic therapy based on the amount of surface area involved.\nClinical Correlate\nTinea versicolor  has some additional features that are important in its management. It presents with \nlesions of different colors from tan to pink (hence the name versicolor). The lesions often do not tan, \nand they present with pale areas in the middle of a normal tan. This can be distinguished from vitiligo \nby the fact that vitiligo has no pigmentation, whereas tinea versicolor presents with altered  pigmentation. \nThe organism may also be contagious. A KOH preparation and fungal culture are used in the same \nmanner as for the other dermatophytes. The main therapeutic difference is the use of topical selenium \nsulfide every 2 to 3 weeks versus oral therapy with itraconazole or fluconazole. This is not because of \nantifungal resistance; it is because tinea versicolor is much more likely to involve large amounts of body \nsurface area so it is difficult to cover this volume of skin with an ordinary topical cream or lotion.\nCandidiasis\nCandidiasis is a yeast infection usually involving skin and mucous membranes, but it can also \nbe systemic. It is caused by  Candida albicans . It usually spreads in patients with decreased host \ndefenses, i.e., those with increased susceptibility due to systemic antibacterial therapy, obesity, \nDM, corticosteroid or antimetabolite therapy, pregnancy, debilitating disease and blood \ndyscrasias, or HIV .\nClinical Presentation\n• Intertriginous infection:  Well-demarcated, erythematous, itchy, exudative patches, \nusually rimmed with small red-based pustules that occur in the groin, gluteal folds \n(diaper rash), axilla, umbilicus, and inframammary areas.\n• Vulvovaginitis: White or yellowish discharge with inflammation of the vaginal wall \nand vulva. Common in pregnant women and patients with diabetes mellitus.\n• Oral candidiasis (thrush): White patches of exudates on tongue or buccal mucosa\n• Candidal paronychia: Painful red swelling around the nail\nDiagnosis.

    "page_458": "Chapter 12   ●  Dermatology\n451\nBacterial Infections\nAntistaphylococcal antibiotics\nThe most common bacterial organisms to cause skin infections of any kind are Staphylococcus  \nand Streptococcus . Antibiotics used to treat Staphylococcus  are dicloxacillin, cephalexin (Keflex™), \nor cefadroxil (Duricef™). Cefadroxil, cefazolin, or cephalexin are the preferred agents. If a patient \nis allergic to penicillin, but the reaction is only a rash, then cephalosporins can be safely used. \nThere is far less than 5% cross-reaction between penicillins and cephalosporins. The IV equiva -\nlents of oral dicloxacillin include oxacillin and nafcillin. The IV equivalent of cefadroxil is \ncefazolin.\nIf the penicillin reaction is anaphylaxis then cephalosporins cannot be used. The alternative \nantibiotics that will treat the skin are macrolides, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, clar -\nithromycin, or the newer fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin). Ciprofloxacin will \nnot adequately cover the skin. Vancomycin is only for IV use for skin infections, and oral \nvancomycin is not absorbed. Oral therapy for MRSA is with clindamycin, TMP/SMX, or \ndoxycycline. The ultimate form of oral MRSA therapy is linezolid.\nImpetigo\nImpetigo is a superficial, pustular skin infection, seen mainly in children (ecthyma is an ulcer -\native form of impetigo), with oozing, crusting, and draining of the lesions. It is a superficial \nbacterial infection of the skin largely limited to the epidermis and not spreading below the \ndermal-epidermal junction. It is caused by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus  and S. aure -\nus (bullous impetigo ).\n• Because it is limited to the epidermis, the purulent material is easily able to express \nitself through the surface; therefore, the patient history will describe the infection \nwith words such as “weeping,” “oozing,” “honey colored,” or “draining.” \n• Occurs more often in warm, humid conditions, particularly when there is poverty and \ncrowding of children. This is because it is both contagious and autoinoculable. \n• More common on arms, legs, and face\n• May follow trauma to skin\n• Begins as maculopapules and rapidly progresses to vesicular pustular lesions or bullae. \nThe crusts are described as having a golden or yellow appearance and if untreated can \nprogress to lymphangitis, furunculosis, or cellulitis, and acute glomerulonephritis. \n• May cause glomerulonephritis, but it will not cause rheumatic fever\nTreatment\n• Oral first-generation cephalosporin or semisynthetic penicillin, e.g., oxacillin, cloxa -\ncillin, dicloxacillin (for severe or widespread cases)\n• Topical mupirocin, bacitracin, or retapamulin for mild cases of impetigo\n• Penicillin-allergic patients can be treated with macrolides such as clarithromycin or \nazithromycin.\n• TMP/SMZ,  clindamycin, or doxycycline for MRSANote\nGroup A streptococci  and S. \naureus  are the most common \ncauses of impetigo.\nNote\nRetapamulin is a topical \nantibacterial more active \nagainst staph and strep than \nmupirocin or bacitracin are.\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   451 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

Erysipelas involves \nboth the dermis and epidermis and is most commonly caused by group A Streptococcus  (pyogenes ).\n• Because it involves lymphatic channels in the dermis, erysipelas is more likely to result \nin fever, chills, and bacteremia. \n• Often involves the face, giving a bright red, angry, swollen appearance\n• Usually bilateral, shiny red, indurated edematous tender lesions on the face, arms, \nand legs\n• Lesions are often sharply demarcated from the surrounding normal skin\n• Differentiate from herpes, contact dermatitis, and angioneurotic edema\nTreatment.  Semisynthetic penicillin or first-generation cephalosporin if you cannot distin-\nguish it from cellulitis; penicillin (if Streptococcus  is certain).\nCellulitis\nCellulitis is a bacterial infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues with Staphylococcus  \nand Streptococcus . Cellulitis is characterized by redness, swelling, and warmth and tenderness \nof the skin. Because it is below the dermal-epidermal junction , there is no oozing, crusting, \nweeping, or draining.\nTreatment.  Cellulitis is treated with the antibiotics prescribed for erysipelas on the basis of the \nseverity of the disease. If there is fever, hypotension, or signs of sepsis or if oral therapy has not \nbeen effective, then the patient should receive IV therapy. Oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin is \nthe best therapy. Treatment is generally empiric because injecting and aspirating sterile saline \nfor a specific microbiologic diagnosis has only a 20% sensitivity. Oral therapy for MRSA is with \nclindamycin, TMP/SMX, or doxycycline.\nFolliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles\nFolliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles represent 3 degrees of severity of staphylococcal infec-\ntions occurring around a hair follicle. Occasionally, folliculitis can be the result of those who \ncontract Pseudomonas  in a whirlpool or from a hot tub.\nAs folliculitis worsens from a simple superficial infection around a hair follicle, it becomes a small \ncollection of infected material known as a furuncle. When several furuncles become confluent \ninto a single lesion, the lesion becomes known as a carbuncle, which is essentially a localized skin \nabscess. Folliculitis is rarely tender, but furuncles and carbuncles are often extremely tender.\nTreatment.  Folliculitis mainly can be treated with warm compresses locally without the need \nfor antibiotics. If antibiotics are required, mupirocin is the best choice. Furuncles and carbun -\ncles require treatment with systemic antistaphylococcal antibiotics, and in the case of carbun -\ncles, should be administered intravenously. Treatment with dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or \ncefadroxil is acceptable. A large furuncle or carbuncle will also require surgical drainage.\nNecrotizing fasciitis\nNecrotizing fasciitis is an extremely severe, life-threatening infection of the skin. It starts as a \ncellulitis that dissects into the fascial planes of the skin. Streptococcus  and Clostridium  are the \nmost common organisms because they are able to produce a toxin that further worsens the \ndamage to the fascia. Diabetes increases the risk of developing fasciitis.Clinical Pearl\nNecrotizing fasciitis is \ncommonly associated with \nvaricella infection, where the \nskin lesions are infected by \nStreptococcus  or Staph .\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   452 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

If there is a definite \ndiagnosis of group A Streptococcus (pyogenes) , then treat with clindamycin and penicillin. \nWithout adequate therapy, necrotizing fasciitis has an 80% mortality rate.\nParonychia\nParonychia is an infection loculated under the skin surrounding a nail. It is generally treated \nwith a small incision to allow drainage and with antistaphylococcal antibiotics. The antistaphy-\nlococcal antibiotics are dicloxacillin, cefadroxil, or cephalexin orally, or oxacillin, nafcillin, or \ncefazolin intravenously.\nViral Infections\nHerpes simplex\nHerpes simplex infections of the genitals are characterized by multiple, painful vesicles. The \nvesicles are usually obvious by examination, and antibiotic therapy should be initiated imme-\ndiately without waiting for results of the tests.\nDiagnosis is made with the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA)  test or HSV PCR . Tzanck test \nand culture are no longer used. Serology is not useful for diagnosing herpes infections.\nImmediate therapy is with oral acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir. Topical acyclovir has \nextremely little efficacy; it will slightly improve resolution in primary lesions and will do \nabsolutely nothing for recurrent herpes simplex lesions. Topical penciclovir has some use for \noral herpetic lesions, but it must be applied every 2 hours. The treatment of acyclovir-resistant \nherpes is with foscarnet.Note\nIf an exam question presents \nan obvious clinical case with \ncrepitus, pain, high fever, and \na portal of entry, you should \nanswer “surgery” (not a test, \nsuch as an x-ray) as the best \ninitial step.\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   453 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

Herpes Simplex Lip\nHerpes zoster/varicella\nChickenpox is primarily a disease of children. Complications of varicella are pneumonia, hepa -\ntitis, and dissemination. Episodes of dermatomal herpes zoster, also known as shingles, occur \nmore frequently in the elderly and in those with defects of the lymphocytic portion of the \nimmune system (i.e., leukemia, lymphoma, HIV , or those on steroids).\nThe vesicles are 2−3 mm in size at all stages of development and are on an erythematous base.\nDiagnosis.  Diagnostic testing is generally not necessary because little else will produce a band \nof vesicles in a dermatomal distribution besides herpes zoster.\nTreatment.  Chickenpox is generally not treated with antivirals. If the child is immunocompro-\nmised or the primary infection occurs in an adult, then acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir \nshould be given.\nSteroid use is still not clearly beneficial, although the best evidence for efficacy is in elderly \npatients with severe pain. The rapid administration of acyclovir still has the best efficacy for \ndecreasing the risk of postherpetic neuralgia.\nOther treatments for managing the pain are gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and topical \ncapsaicin. The most effective analgesic specific for postherpetic neuralgia is gabapentin. \nNonimmune adults exposed to chickenpox should receive varicella zoster immunoglobulin \nwithin 96 hours of the exposure in order for it to be effective.\nMolluscum contagiosum\nMolluscum contagiosum  is skin-colored, waxy, umbilicated papules. It is caused by poxvirus. It \nis commonly seen in children; frequency is increased in patients infected with HIV .\nSmall papules appear anywhere on the skin (genital and pubic area), usually by venereal \ncontact, and are asymptomatic. The lesions have a central umbilication. They can be transmit-\nted by skin-to-skin contact or sexually. \n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   454 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

It involves vesicular eruptions resulting from the females of the Sarcoptes \nscabiei (hominis)  burrowing into the skin. It is caused by the itch mite, Sarcoptes scabiei . \nTransmission is by skin-to-skin contact.\nScabies primarily involves the web spaces of the hands and feet. It also produces pruritic \nlesions around the penis, breasts, and axillary folds. Itching can be extreme. Because Sarcoptes \nscabiei  is quite small, all that can be seen with the naked eye are the burrows and excoriations \naround small pruritic vesicles. Scabies often spares the head. Immunocompromised patients, \nsuch as those with HIV , are particularly vulnerable to an extremely exuberant form of scabies \nwith severe crusting and malodorousness, known as Norwegian scabies.\nDiagnosis in all cases is confirmed by scraping out the organism after mineral oil is applied to \na burrow; however, skin scrapings are usually not necessary and are not routinely done.\nTreat with permethrin. Lindane (Kwell) has equal efficacy, but also greater toxicity. Lindane should \nnot be used in pregnant women. Ivermectin is a suitable alternative and is given as oral therapy if \nthe disease is extensive. Treat Norwegian scabies with a combination of permethrin and ivermectin.\nPediculosis\nPediculosis is skin infestation by lice. It is caused by the following:\n• Head: Pediculus humanus capitis\n• Body: Pediculus humanus corporis\n• Pubic area: Phthirus pubis  (“crab louse”)\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   455 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

Treat with \npermethrin or lindane (Kwell).\nTOXIN-MEDIATED DISEASES\nToxic Shock Syndrome\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a systemic reaction to a toxin produced from Staphylococcus  \nattached to a foreign body. The majority of cases now are not from a menstrual source, such as a \ntampon or vaginal packing. Nasal packing, retained sutures, or any other form of surgical \nmaterial retained in the body can promote the growth of the type of staphylococci that produces \nthe toxin.\nBecause there is no single specific test, cases are matters of definition. \nTSS is defined as the presence of 3 or more of the following findings: \n• Fever >102 F\n• Systolic BP <90 mm Hg\n• Desquamative rash\n• Vomiting\n• Involvement of the mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, or genitals \n• Elevated bilirubin\n• Platelets <100,000\nIn addition, TSS is a systemic disease:\n• Raises creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, and liver function tests\n• Lowers platelet count\n• Can cause CNS dysfunction such as confusion\n• Often produces hypocalcemia (usually because of a diffuse capillary leak syndrome \nthat drops the albumin level)\nStreptococcal toxic shock syndrome is essentially the same.\nTo treat, remove the source of the infection and give vigorous fluid resuscitation, pressors (e.g., \ndopamine), and antibiotics. Empiric treatment is with clindamycin plus vancomycin until \ncultures return. In confirmed cases of methicillin-sensitive strains, treat with clindamycin plus \nan antistaphylococcal medication (oxacillin, nafcillin). In methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA), \nuse vancomycin or linezolid.\nStaphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome\nStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is transmitted through physical contact with \nsurroundings. It most commonly occurs in infants, young children, and the immunocompromised.\n12_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch12.indd   456 16/05/19   11:20 AM",

Benign lesions, such as the junctional or intradermal nevus, do \nnot grow in size and have smooth, regular borders with a diameter usually <1 cm. In addition, \nthey are homogenous in color, and this remains constant.

The Koebner phenomenon is \nthe development of lesions with epidermal injury.\nTreatment.  Salicylic acid is used to remove heaped-up collections of scaly material so that the \nother therapies can make contact. If the disease is relatively localized, topical steroids are used. \nSevere disease also needs coal tar or anthralin derivatives. To avoid the long-term use of \nsteroids, which can cause skin atrophy, and to avoid coal tars, which are messy to use, substi-\ntute topical vitamin D and vitamin A derivatives.

Standard x-rays are based on the degree \nof density of tissue and how much x-ray energy each type of tissue will absorb. \n• The closer a bone structure is in density, the greater the energy it will absorb.\n• Therefore, because bones block the most amount of x-ray energy, they will come out \nwhite on the film. \n• Conversely, air absorbs or blocks the least amount of energy and thus will appear darkest.\nChest x-rays are not routine  screening tests. There is no routine screening of the general popula-\ntion for cancer or tuberculosis. Y ou can do a chest x-ray if the PPD skin test is positive, but that is \nnot the same thing as just doing a general screening.\nMost x-rays are posterior-anterior (P A)  films. The x-ray plate is placed in front of the chest, and \nthe patient leans forward against the plate. The x-ray beam is directed from posterior to anterior. \nThe patient must be able to stand for a PA film to be performed.\nAnterior-posterior (AP)  films are less accurate but must be done if the patient is too ill or \nunstable to stand up.\n• All patients with central venous lines or chest tubes\n• Unstable patients, such as those in intensive care\nThe single greatest difference between the film types is heart size:\n• AP films will show a heart size that is artificially enlarged; that is because the heart is \nmore anterior in the chest and will therefore cast a wider shadow.\n• AP films  will show a heart >50% of the total transthoracic diameter, while normal PA \nfilms  will show a heart <50%. Note\nThe phenomenon produced \nby AP film  is no different than \nholding your hand in a light \nshined against a wall. The \nfarther your hand is away \nfrom the wall, the larger your \nhand’s shadow will appear.Radiology/Imaging 13\n13_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch13.indd   465 16/05/19   11:25 AM",
    "page_473": "466\nUSMLE Step 2 CK   l  Internal Medicine\nTechnical Aspects of Normal Film Quality\n• When examining a chest x-ray, first assess the film for its technical quality. If the \npatient’s body is abnormally rotated, the film will be less accurate. You can determine \nthis by seeing if the trachea and the spinous apophysis are midway between the \nclavicles.\n• Perform chest x-ray when the patient is holding in a full inhalation. There should be at \nleast 10 ribs visible, counting from top to bottom.\n• An underexposed film will have the structures appearing too white, while an overex -\nposed film will have the blood vessels appearing too dark (preventing one from \naccurately assessing the blood vessels).\n• Note that on a PA film, the right hemidiaphragm is typically higher than the left. That \nis because the liver is underneath the right hemidiaphragm, pushing it up.\nExpiratory Films\nExpiratory films are used when one is looking for a pneumothorax. The lungs will appear \nsmaller because less air will remain in the lungs on expiration. Because a pneumothorax is air \noutside the lungs in the pleural space, this air will appear relatively larger. The volume of air in \nthe pleural space does not decrease on exhalation.\nLateral Chest X-ray\nLateral chest x-ray will determine whether a structure in the chest is more anterior or poste-\nrior. For example, it can determine whether a mass that is visible in the center of the mediasti-\nnum on a PA film is posterior, making it more likely to be a neurally derived tumor attached to \nthe spinal cord or an anterior mass. Anterior mediastinal masses are from the thymus, thyroid, \nlymph nodes, or a teratoma.\nLateral x-ray also has a greater sensitivity for the detection of small pleural effusions. \n• On a PA film, at least 100-200 mL of fluid needs to be present to even begin to see an \neffusion. Each hemithorax can contain 3 liters of fluid if it is filled to capacity. \n• Lateral chest x-ray can detect as little as 50 mL. \n• These figures represent the amount of fluid needed to barely begin seeing “blunting,” \nor obliteration, of the costophrenic angle.\nOn a lateral x-ray, the right hemidiaphragm is the one crossing the heart shadow.\nDecubitus Film\nDecubitus film helps detect the presence of a pleural effusion. It is taken with the patient lying \non his side, and is employed when blunting or obscuration of the costophrenic angle is seen on \na PA or lateral x-ray. \nEffusions will move and form a layer on the side of the chest wall. Infiltrates from alveolar \ndisease do not move with gravity. Y ou cannot determine if an effusion is infected just from its \nappearance on an x-ray. Note\nThe right hemidiaphragm will \nappear higher on a lateral \nx-ray and a PA film because \nthe liver pushes it upward.\n13_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch13.indd   466 16/05/19   11:25 AM",
    "page_474": "Chapter 13   ●  Radiology/Imaging\n467\nCOMMON DISORDERS SEEN ON CHEST X-RAY\nCOPD/Emphysema\nThe most common appearance of COPD on a chest x-ray is related to hyperinflation of the \nlung . \n• Leads to a darkening of the lung fields because more air is present\n• Trapped air flattens the diaphragm and gives the impression of an elongated or \ntubular-shaped heart because it has been stretched down\n• Leads to increased anterior/posterior diameter, or “barrel chest” \n• Bullae may be seen (large, air-filled cavities that can give thin, white lines on a chest \nx-ray as walls of the cavities press up against each other)\nPneumo nia\n• Lobar pneumonia causes a whitening of each individual lobe of the lung because of \ngreater density of the lung\n• “Silhouette” sign is present (border between the affected lobe and surrounding denser \nstructure is obscured) \n• Density of the lung increases because of alveolar infiltration to the point where it \ntakes on the density of the nearby heart or diaphragm; thus, one can no longer tell \nwhere the lung ends and the nearby denser structure begins\n• Lower lobe  pneumonia gives a silhouette over each half of the diaphragm. Right \nmiddle-lobe  pneumonia obscures the right heart border and will not pass the minor \nor horizontal fissure seen on a PA chest x-ray. Upper-lobe infiltration will not pass the \nmajor fissure, and this is more easily seen on a lateral x-ray. You cannot determine a \nspecific microbiologic etiology from the x-ray alone.\n• Diseases of the lung outside the airspace but in the interstitial membrane give a fine, \nlacy appearance visible in most, if not all, of the lobes. Disorders which give intersti -\ntial infiltrates include  Pneumocystis  pneumonia, Mycoplasma , viruses, chlamydia, and \nsometimes Legionella . Noninfectious etiologies of an interstitial infiltrate are pulmo -\nnary fibrosis secondary to silicosis, asbestosis, mercury poisoning, berylliosis, byssino -\nsis (from cotton), or simply idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. As the long-standing \ndisorders become worse and more chronic, a greater degree of fibrosis occurs and \nleads to greater thickening of the membrane (described as  reticular-nodular  and, later, \nhoneycombing).Note\nInterstitial Syndromes of the \nLung include:\nSarcoidosis\nHistiocytosis X\nIPF (interstitial pulmonary \nfibrosis)\nTumor\nFailure\nAsbestosis\nCollagen disorders\nEnvironmental\nDust\nDrugs\n13_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch13.indd   467 16/05/19   11:25 AM",

Pneumonia\nCongestive Heart Failure\nThe majority of pulmonary vascular flow is normally at the base of the lungs because of gravity. \nWhen there is fluid overload, the blood vessels toward the apices become fuller (called \npulmonary vascular congestion or “cephalization” of flow). The term cephalization  is used \nbecause more flow is moving toward the head. \nThe other findings associated with CHF are cardiomegaly, effusions, and Kerley B lines.\nKerley B lines are the least important.

When fluid builds up within each lobe, in \nbetween the lobules, this is known as a Kerley B line. \nPosition of Lines and Tubes\nChest x-rays are routinely used to determine the appropriate position of central venous lines and \nboth endotracheal and chest tubes. The proper position of the tip of an endotracheal tube is 1 to 2 \ncm above the carina. It is important to keep some space above the carina so that when the head \nmoves forward, the tube does not push into the carina, which is extremely uncomfortable and will \nprovoke coughing. The tip of central venous lines is at the junction of the superior vena cava and \nthe right atrium, at the point where the right mainstem bronchus is seen. The tip of the line should \nnot be fully inside the atrium because this can irritate the heart and may provoke an arrhythmia.\nAir under the Diaphragm\nWhen there is perforation of an abdominal hollow organ, such as the duodenum, air is \nreleased and is visible under the diaphragm. The proper film to detect this is a chest x-ray \ntaken in the upright position. This will allow the air to collect under the diaphragm, which \nshould be easily visible. Abdominal x-rays do not always visualize the top of the diaphragm \nbecause of differences in body size. Chest x-rays always visualize the top of the diaphragm.Note\nThe subtle radiologic finding \nwith Kerley B line is less \nimportant today in the \nevaluation of congestive heart \nfailure, since the advent of \nechocardiography.\n13_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch13.indd   468 16/05/19   11:25 AM",

Only 10−15% of gallstones can be \ndetected on an abdominal film because most of them do not calcify.\n• Pancreatic calcifications can be detected in 30−50% of patients with chronic pancreatitis.\nSonography (U/S)\nSonography is used for evaluation of abdominal and pelvic pathology. Sonograms should be \nemployed first for evaluation of the biliary tract because of their accuracy in evaluating  dilation \nand obstruction of the ducts. The majority of cholelithiasis should be detected with sonography \nbecause cholesterol gallstones should be easily visible by sonography. The majority of nephroli -\nthiasis is visible by sonography, although there is less accuracy in detecting stones in the ureters \nbecause they become retroperitoneal structures.\nSonography is useful in the evaluation of masses in the liver, spleen, pancreas, and pelvis, as \nwell as for evaluating the presence of ascites. Despite this accuracy, CT scanning tends to have \na greater sensitivity and specificity for the abdomen and pelvis. Sonography is  particularly \nvaluable in the evaluation of pregnant patients because it avoids radiation exposure to the \nfetus. Although less accurate, sonography is also practical in patients who have an absolute \ncontraindication to the use of IV contrast. A total of 1:10,000 patients have a life-  threatening \nreaction to the use of iodinated contrast agents.\nThere is very little utility of sonography in the evaluation of thoracic structures because the \nribs block the sound waves. Also, sonography in the evaluation of intracranial structures, such \nas the brain, is not recommended because the skull blocks the sound waves.\nEndoscopic U/S involves introducing a sonographic device into the abdomen at the end of an \nendoscope. Endoscopic U/S is extremely accurate in evaluating pancreatic pathology that is \nnot easily visualized on CT scanning, such as a gastrinoma. Pancreatic lesions can also be \neffectively evaluated in this way.\n13_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch13.indd   470 16/05/19   11:25 AM",

ERCP is for \ntherapy. The endoscope is introduced into the small bowel, and a catheter is placed through the \nsphincter of Oddi. Contrast is injected through the catheter. This allows extremely accurate \nvisualization of the pancreatic ductal and biliary systems. ERCP is excellent for detecting stric -\ntures, stones, and neoplastic causes of obstruction. The other advantages of ERCP are the ability to \nperform therapy with the removal of these stones, to dilate strictures, and to perform biopsies. The \nscope does not routinely go up the sphincter of Oddi because it is too large to pass. MRCP is an \nMRI alternative to ERCP . It is less invasive than ERCP but does not allow an intervention.\nThe most common complication of ERCP is acute pancreatitis (around 10% in some series). \nMost of the time the pancreatitis is mild.\nBarium Studies\nBarium studies of the large bowel are never as accurate for colonic pathology as is endoscopy. \nIn addition, you cannot biopsy with barium studies or perform therapeutic procedures, such as \ncautery or epinephrine injection for bleeding. The upper GI series is never as accurate as is \nupper endoscopy for the same reasons.\nHowever, barium studies of the esophagus are a good test to start with for the evaluation of \nesophageal pathology. Barium esophagogram is particularly good for the detection of \n strictures, rings, and webs, or Zenker diverticulum. Barium is not as accurate as an upper \nendoscopy for the detection of esophageal cancer because a biopsy is required. (Endoscopy is \nfar superior for the detection and therapy of esophageal varices as well.) Barium is not as \naccurate as manometry for the confirmation of the diagnoses of achalasia or muscular disor -\nders, such as diffuse esophageal spasm and nutcracker esophagus.\nCapsule Endoscopy\nThe ileum and jejunum are the hardest parts of the bowel to visualize by radiologic studies or \nendoscopy. In the past, a “push enteroscopy” was performed by introducing an extremely long, \nthin scope into the small bowel. Capsule endoscopy is a new technology that allows direct \nvisualization of the small bowel by swallowing a camera that electronically relays thousands of \nphotographic images from the small bowel to a receiver outside the body. The drawback of this \nprocedure is that it is not possible to perform therapeutic interventions in this way. If a patient \nhas GI bleeding that is serious and both upper and lower endoscopy do not reveal the source, \nthen answer “capsule endoscopy” on the exam.\nHIDA Scanning\nThis is a nuclear medicine scan useful only in the detection of acute cholecystitis. HIDA scanning \nis most useful in patients in whom the diagnosis of cholecystitis is not clear. An abnormal or \npositive test is the lack of visualization of the gallbladder. This is because the neck of the gallblad -\nder or cystic duct becomes too edematous to allow the passage of the nuclear material. A normal \nscan will visualize the gallbladder. An abnormal scan will not visualize or fill the gallbladder.Note\nMRCP: diagnosis\nERCP: treatment\nClinical Pearl\nCapsule endoscopy is not a \nscreening test to detect colon \ncancer.

They are \nparticularly useful in determining whether lesions that are visible on a CT scan of the chest are \nmalignant or benign. Cancer is typically associated with the increased uptake of fluorodeoxy-\nglucose. PET scanning is used after chemotherapy to assess for the presence of residual cancer \nin some patients and can also be used to determine whether a patient is an operative candidate \nto remove a primary cancer. If the PET scan does not reveal malignancy, then the resection of \ncertain primary cancers, such as lung cancer, is more likely to be successful.\nRemember that slow-growing cancers (e.g., bronchoalveolar) may have a negative PET scan. \nBe careful when evaluating pulmonary nodules with PET scanning.Clinical Pearl\nAlways check the patient’s \nglucose before doing a PET \nscan.

The MRI is superior for the detection of stroke, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and \ninfections and in the evaluation of the posterior fossa, such as the cerebellum and brainstem.\nThe CT scan does not visualize the brainstem well. For example, a stroke is visible on an MRI \nin >90% of cases within the first 24 hours after its onset, whereas the CT scan needs 3 to 4 days \nbefore >90% are visible. This is because the MRI is based on the water content of tissues rather \nthan on the calcium content or simple density of tissue. Within a few hours after the onset of a \nstroke, the cells begin to swell and increase their water content. This is immediately visible on \nan MRI, whereas for a CT scan to detect an abnormality, the cells must die to decrease the den -\nsity of visible cells.\nThe single exception in which a CT scan is superior to an MRI is in the detection of blood. As \nsoon as bleeding occurs, it is visible on a CT scan. Therefore, the two cases in which a CT scan \nis a better study are to evaluate head trauma and to exclude hemorrhagic stroke. When a \npatient arrives within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms of a stroke, a CT scan is first \nperformed to exclude hemorrhage. This is to see if a patient is eligible for the use of thrombo-\nlytic therapy within these first 3 hours.\nA CT scan is also used first for the detection of subarachnoid hemorrhage. On the first day \nafter the stroke’s onset, the CT scan has 95% sensitivity. The sensitivity diminishes by about 5% \nper day as the blood is hemolyzed and removed.\nContrast on a scan of the head is indicated primarily for the detection of cancers and infection. \nWhen an abscess or neoplastic process is present, there is some disruption of the blood-brain \nbarrier, causing some extravasation of the contrast, which is visible as a contrast, or “ring”-\nenhancing lesion around the mass.\nBONE IMAGING\nAn x-ray is certainly the first study to implement when evaluating trauma and fracture. \nUnfortunately, the bone scan has much less specificity and does not reliably distinguish \nbetween bone infection and infection of the overlying soft tissue. The MRI is both 90 to 95% \nsensitive and 90 to 95% specific.\nOsteomyelitis\nWhen there is the suspicion of osteomyelitis, then an x-ray is done first. Although plain x-rays \nlack sensitivity for the first 1 to 2 weeks, the specificity for osteomyelitis is excellent. More than \n50% of the calcium content of bone must be lost for osteomyelitis to be visible. The earliest \nfinding of osteomyelitis on an x-ray is elevation of the periosteum. If the film returns normal \nand there is still suspicion of osteomyelitis, then the best test is an MRI. The MRI and techne-\ntium nuclear bone scan have the same sensitivity (90–95%); however, the MRI’s specificity is \nfar greater (90–95%). Both studies should become abnormal within 2 days of the onset of \nosteomyelitis. Therefore, a negative bone scan is very useful if it is normal; it means that there \nis no osteomyelitis. If it is abnormal, you may still need to  perform an MRI.\n13_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch13.indd   473 16/05/19   11:25 AM",

This is identical in pathogenesis to the damage that diabetes causes to all \nblood vessels in the body, such as in the heart, kidney, brain, and peripheral nervous system. The \nendothelial lining of the retinal vessels becomes damaged, leading to progressive occlusion on a \nmicroscopic level. The occlusion leads to obstruction and increased pressure.\n• The earliest form of this adverse effect on the retina is called nonproliferative  (or \nbackground ) retinopathy. It is characterized by dilation of veins, microaneurysms, \nretinal edema, and retinal hemorrhages. Hemorrhages into the retina are not as damag -\ning as intravitreal hemorrhages because they do not obstruct sight.\n• Proliferative  retinopathy is a more advanced form of the disease and is markedly more \nserious, meaning it progresses more rapidly to blindness. As the microvascular damage \nto the vessels worsens, these vessels secrete increased amounts of an angiogenesis factor. \nThe vessels are not providing sufficient nutrition to the retina. The vessels themselves \nexert an increased effort to have more of them produced in an effort to deliver more \nnutrition and oxygen to the retina. Unfortunately, this “neovascularization,” or new \nblood vessel formation, leads to the optic nerve getting covered with abnormal new vessel \nformation. In addition, hemorrhages protrude into the vitreous chamber. Vitreal hemor -\nrhages are much more serious than microaneurysms or intraretinal hemorrhages because \nthey are much more sight threatening.\nThe whole point of therapy for diabetic retinopathy is to first prevent the patient from ever \nprogressing to the proliferative phase and, second, to slow down the disease’s progress with laser \nphotocoagulation, if it occurs.\nClinical Presentation.  The clinical presentation of diabetic retinopathy is highly variable. There \nmay be very advanced disease occurring with no symptoms. Vision may decrease slowly or rapidly. \nVitreal hemorrhages may develop suddenly, and patients will complain of “floaters” in their vision.Ophthalmology 14\n14_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch14.indd   475 16/05/19   11:26 AM",

Screening for the presence of retinopathy should be performed on an annual basis \nby an ophthalmologist. This is how candidates for fluorescein angiography and laser photoco-\nagulation are found. Fluorescein helps identify which vessels should undergo laser photoco-\nagulation. The laser selectively destroys focal areas of the retina and diminishes the production \nof the angiogenesis factor, which causes the proliferative retinopathy.\nTreatment  of both stages of diabetic retinopathy involves the attempt to have tight control of \nglucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels. Proliferative retinopathy additionally involves \nimmediate treatment with laser photocoagulation. Aspirin, clopidogrel, and other platelet-\ninhibiting medications have shown no benefit. The more tightly the glucose is controlled \nwithin the normal range, the slower the progression of the retinopathy. Blood pressure should \nbe controlled to a level of <130/80 mm Hg.\nDiabetes is considered by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) to be the \nequivalent to coronary artery disease in terms of its effect on cardiac mortality and on LDL \ntargets. Even if there is no evidence of coronary artery disease, the target LDL in a diabetic \npatient is <100 mg/dL. If the patient is diabetic and has evidence of coronary disease, then the \ntarget LDL can be as low as <70 mg/dL.

The term rheg-\nmatogenous , which is used to describe the detachment, is from the Greek word for “tear. ” The \ntwo most common predisposing factors are myopia and surgical extraction of cataracts. \nTraction on the retina can also occur from proliferative retinopathy from diabetes, retinal vein \nocclusion, and age-related macular degeneration.\nThe most common presentation is blurry vision developing in one eye without pain or  redness. \nThe patient may complain of seeing “floaters, ” as well as flashes at the periphery of vision. \nSometimes it is described as a “curtain coming down, ” as the retina falls off the sclera behind \nit. Diagnosis is made by ophthalmologic examination.\nTreatment.  Various methods of trying to reattach the retina are employed. Patients should \nlean their heads back to promote the chance that the retina will fall back into place. The retina \ncan be mechanically reattached to the sclera surgically, by laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, \nor by the injection of expansile gas into the vitreal cavity. The gas will press the retina back into \nplace. A “buckle, ” or belt, can be placed around the sclera to push the sclera forward so that it \ncan come into contact with the retina. If all of these methods fail to reattach the retina, then \nthe vitreous can be removed and the retina can be surgically attached to the sclera.

These deposits are known as “drusen. ” They are small, granular, subretinal \ndeposits that are age related.\n14_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch14.indd   477 16/05/19   11:26 AM",

Diagnosis is confirmed by finding clearly visible drusen on dilated eye \nexam. Dry-type ARMD leads to visual loss of a slow, gradual nature.\n• A wet, or exudative, form is characterized by the abnormal growth of vessels from the \nchoroidal circulation into the subretinal space. These vessels leak, leading to collec -\ntions of subretinal fluid and a localized, exudative retinal detachment. Wet type can \npresent with the rapid distortion of vision over weeks to months. Fluorescein angiog -\nraphy will help confirm the diagnosis of exudative ARMD.\nTreatment.  There is no clear evidence that any therapy will stop the progression of  dry-type \nARMD . There is some evidence that zinc, antioxidant vitamins such as vitamins C and E, and \nbeta-carotene may retard progression of the disease. \nWet-type ARMD  is treated with VEGF inhibitors ranibizumab and bevacizumab.\nCentral Retinal Artery Occlusion\nThere are various etiologies of central retinal artery occlusion: carotid artery embolic  disease, \ntemporal arteritis, cardiac thrombi or myxoma, or any of the usual causes of thrombophilia \nsuch as factor V Leiden mutation.\nPatients present with a sudden, painless, unilateral loss of vision. There is no redness of the \neye. Ophthalmoscopy reveals a pale retina, with overall diminished perfusion and a “cherry-\nred” spot at the fovea.

Patients are asymptomatic for a long \ntime, and this is the reason why it is important to screen older patients.\nThe first clue to the diagnosis is a cup-to-disk ratio >0.5 , which should be confirmed by \nrepeated elevation in intraocular pressure as determined by tonometry.\nTreatment is based on decreasing the production of aqueous humor while increasing its drainage. \n• Medications that decrease the production of aqueous humor  are beta-blockers \n(timolol, betaxolol, levobunolol), alpha-adrenergic agonists (apraclonidine, brimoni -\ndine), and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide and brinzolamide).\n• Medications that  increase the outflow of the humor  are prostaglandin analogs such \nas topical latanoprost, travoprost, and bimatoprost.

The cornea has a hazy cloudiness, and there is marked diminishment of visual \nacuity.\nTreatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma is an ophthalmologic emergency. Use IV \n acetazolamide, urea, and osmotic diuretics such as mannitol and glycerol.\nPilocarpine can be used to open the canal of Schlemm, and beta-blockers are used to  decrease \nhumor production. If these medical therapies are ineffective, laser trabeculoplasty can be \nperformed.\nCATARACTS\nCataracts are opacifications of the lens. They are slowly progressive, with a blurring of  vision \noccurring over months to years. Glare from the headlights of cars is particularly a problem \nwhen driving at night. Color perception is reduced in general. The etiology of cataracts is \nunknown, although there is an association with cigarette smoking.\nMature cataracts can be easily seen on physical examination. Earlier-stage disease is seen with \na slit lamp.\nThere is no medical therapy for cataracts. Surgical removal with the placement of an intraocu-\nlar lens is the standard of care.\nCONJUNCTIVAL DISEASES\nConjunctivitis\nConjunctivitis can occur from any infectious agent, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\n• Bacterial conjunctivitis  is often unilateral and presents with a marked purulent \ndischarge from the eye. This is most symptomatic in the morning, when the patient’s \neye has developed a significant crust overnight, sometimes making it hard to open the \neye. There is less itching compared with viral conjunctivitis. Although the eye can be \nred, there is a normally reactive pupil, normal ocular pressure, and no impairment of \nvisual acuity.\n• Viral conjunctivitis  is often bilateral, with severe ocular itching and enlarged preau -\nricular adenopathy. The eyes are also red, but there is a normally reactive pupil and no \nphotophobia.\nTreat bacterial conjunctivitis  with a topical antibiotic such as erythromycin ointment, \n sulfacetamide drops, or topical fluoroquinolones. \n14_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch14.indd   480 16/05/19   11:26 AM",

The most common cause is trauma, particularly in the presence of \nthrombocytopenia. The collection of the hematoma stops at the limbus, which is the anatomic \nconnection between the conjunctiva and the cornea.

In cases of penicillin \nallergy, use a first-generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin.\nUVEITIS\nUveitis occurs when the structures of the uveal tract (the iris, ciliary body, and choroid) \nbecome inflamed. It is caused by various systemic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, \nsarcoidosis, syphilis, Reiter syndrome, and IBD.\n14_USMLE_Int_Med_Ch14.indd   481 16/05/19   11:26 AM",
